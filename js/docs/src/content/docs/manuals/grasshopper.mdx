# 🧠 Semio Toolbar Overview

---

## 🧠 Assistant  
The Assistant tab includes helpful utilities that simplify working with Semio, such as auto-suggestions, data diagnostics, or interactive prompts. These tools assist you while modeling and assembling designs, making it easier to understand your setup and fix issues quickly.

---

## 🖼️ Display  
The Display tab handles all visual feedback in the canvas. Use it to preview your complete design, individual Pieces, or just connections. These tools help you inspect logic visually and confirm the spatial outcome of your snapping rules and placements.

---

## 🔎 Filter  
The Filter tab lets you query, sort, and extract specific elements from your model — such as only selected Pieces, certain Types, or Ports with a specific role. Ideal for downstream workflows where you want to operate on subsets of your full system.

---

## 🔌 Integrations  
The Integrations tab is where Semio connects to external systems — whether it’s BIM tools, databases, or collaborative plugins. These components help you translate or synchronize Semio logic with other platforms and formats.

---

## 🧱 Modeling  
The Modeling tab contains all core components to define your design system: Types, Variants, Representations, Ports, Pieces, Connections, and full Designs. This is the heart of Semio — where your LEGO-like logic is actually built.

---

## 🧩 Params  
The Params tab lists all Semio’s custom parameter types — like Type, Piece, Connection, and Design. Use these to define inputs, share data across clusters, or inspect the structure of Semio objects in detail.

---

## 💾 Persistence  
The Persistence tab allows you to save, store, and reload Semio data — such as Types or Designs — across Grasshopper sessions. It enables a hybrid workflow between live modeling and data caching.

---

## 🧠 Scripting  
The Scripting tab gives access to low-level component versions (e.g. ⩾Dn, ⩾Ty) that expose raw Semio logic, ideal for advanced users and developers. You can build or manipulate Semio objects programmatically with these minimal building blocks.

---

## 🧩 Templates  
The Templates tab includes example setups, scaffolds, and bootstraps for common modeling patterns. Use these to quickly kick off a modular system with ready-to-go logic and best-practice structure.

---

## 🛠️ Util  
The Util tab contains general-purpose utilities — from data transformation and set operations to type conversion and statistics. These are helpers to bridge standard Grasshopper data with Semio’s logic model.
