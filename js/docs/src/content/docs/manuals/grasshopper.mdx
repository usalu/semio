# üß† Semio Grasshopper components Overview 

---

## üß† Assistant  
The Assistant tab includes helpful utilities that simplify working with Semio, such as auto-suggestions, data diagnostics, or interactive prompts These tools assist you while modeling and assembling designs, making it easier to understand your setup and fix issues quickly

- **Assess Performance**: Simple performance assement based on the following qualities of the types (No unit conversion is applied for now, so make sure that all your types have the values with the same unit): floor area, effective floor area, residents, workspaces, construction cost, maintenance expenses, income, transmission heat loss, ventilation heat loss, cooling energy demand, technical equipment energy demand,construction global warming potential, heating load, cooling load, ventilation air flow volume
- **Predict Design**: Predict a design

---

## üñºÔ∏è Display  
The Display tab handles all visual feedback in the canvas Use it to preview your complete design, individual Pieces, or just connections These tools help you inspect logic visually and confirm the spatial outcome of your snapping rules and placements

- **Preview Connections**: Preview all connections of a design by visualizing the ports of the types and the connection parameters
- **Preview Design**: Preview the pieces and connections of a design
- **Preview Geometry**: Preview geometry by ungrouping everything, showing light surfaces and dark edges
- **Preview Pieces**: Preview pieces in a design Use tags to select matching representations of the types of the pieces
- **Preview Port**: Preview a port by showing the point and direction and if exists: id, family and compatible families
- **Draw Diagram**: Draw the diagram of the design
---

## üîé Filter  
The Filter tab lets you query, sort, and extract specific elements from your model ‚Äî such as only selected Pieces, certain Types, or Ports with a specific role Ideal for downstream workflows where you want to operate on subsets of your full system

- **Select Kit**: Select a kit with a name and an optional version
- **Select Design**: Select a design with a name, an optional variant and an optional view
- **Select Type**: Select a type with a name and an optional variant If no variant is provided it will select all variants If you want to select the default type then use the empty text
- **Select Type by Piece**: Select the type of a piece
- **Select Connection**: Select a connection with the connected id and the connecting id The connections are symetric, so if the conected is the connecting and vice versa it will still selct them
- **Select Pieces**: Select pieces of a certain type If no variant is provided it will select all variants If you want to select the default type then use the empty text
- **Select Piece**: Select a piece with the id
- **Select Fixed**: Select a fixed piece A piece is fixed when it has a plane (and a center)
- **Select Port**: Select a port with the id If no port matches, null is returned
- **Select Representation**: Select exactly one representation based on tags The tag matching is based on the highest Jaccard index (|‚à©|/|‚à™|)
- **Select Quality**: Select a quality by its name If no quality matches, null is returned
---

## üîå Integrations  
The Integrations tab is where Semio connects to external systems ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs BIM tools, databases, or collaborative plugins These components help you translate or synchronize Semio logic with other platforms and formats

- **Design to Block**: Bake the design to blocks: by selecting a representation with mime and tags and turn it to block-definitions and flatten the design and turn every piece into a block-definition with the plane as it transform
- **Pieces to Group**: Convert every piece to a group If you need more a sophisticated approach where you can switch between represenstations and don't waste space use: Design to Block
- **GitHub Kit**: Get the uri and the homepage of the remote kit of a specific version (either a branch name, a tag name or a commit sha) for a kit hosted as a repository on GitHub If you don't want the main branch, you have to clear the branch param
- **GitLab Kit**: Get the uri and the homepage of the remote kit of a specific version (either a branch name, a tag name or a commit sha) for a kit hosted as a repository on GitLab If you don't want the main branch, you have to clear the branch param
- **Type to PART**: Convert a semio type to a Wasp PART In semio connections are parametric (rotation, gap, tilt, shift) which can't be translated because Wasp CONN are statically defined by a plane You can lock this degree of freedom by providing an additional rotation to each port @devs If you want to debug this cluster, lock the solver (otherwise your Rhino might crash due to a Grasshopper bug) and look at the instructions inside Password: debug
- **Filter PART**: Filter PARTs with indices RULEs are also filtered to only include those with filtered PARTs
- **AGGR to Design**: Convert a Wasp aggregation (AGGR) to a semio design
- **Design to AGGR**: Convert a semio design to a Wasp aggregation (AGGR)
- **Types to Modules**: Convert semio types to Monoceros modules
- **Slots to Design**: Convert Monoceros slots to a semio designv
