## 🧩 Model Piece

**Category:** Modeling  
**Outputs:** `Pc` (Piece)

---

### 📄 Description
Defines a **Piece** — a placed instance of a `Type` — with a name, placement, and optional visual geometry

---

### 🧰 Inputs

| Input              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`            | Local identifier of the Piece. Must be unique within the Design. 📛          |
| `Type`            | Reference to a `Ty` (Type) this Piece is based on. 🧩                        |
| `Plane`           | Optional placement plane of the Piece. If omitted, must be connected. ◳     |
| `Diagram Center`  | Optional center location in the design diagram (2D). Used for layouting. ⌖ |
| `Preview Geometry`| Optional geometry to preview, without affecting the actual Type. 🖼️         |
| `Quality`         | Optional qualities like floor area, cost, etc., used in performance metrics. 📏|

### 🎯 Outputs

| Output  | Description                           |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `Pc`    | A fully defined Semio Piece object ⭕  |

### 🧱 Behaviors
Semio components support three operations:

- **Construct:** Build a new Piece from the inputs above.
- **Deconstruct:** Plug a `Pc` into the first input to unpack its structure.
- **Reconstruct:** Modify an existing Piece by combining a `Pc` with new inputs. Only changed inputs will be updated.

> 🧩 **Example:** Flip the first piece in your Hello Semio logo by injecting a new `Plane` while keeping the rest intact.

- `Model Connection` → to snap Pieces together 🔗

### 💡 Tips

- A Piece must reference a Type.
- If a Plane is missing, the Piece must be part of a Connection chain.
- Use preview geometry to test variations without altering the Type.
- Add Tags and Icons to organize Pieces visually in Studio.
