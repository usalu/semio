## 🧩 What is semio?

**semio** is not just a tool ➡️ it's a new way to design architecture.

Think in **systems**, not surfaces.  
Design with **rules and relationships**, not just lines and layers.  
Build **intelligent, reusable parts** that evolve with your project.

Work as a **team**, not in silos ➡️ semio is made for **collaborative design**, where design logic can be shared, edited, and extended together.

And you're never locked in. semio is **platform-independent** and open ➡️ it works alongside your favorite tools, not against them.

Create architecture that’s modular, adaptable, and ready to grow ➡️ from sketch to system.


## ❌ What semio is _not_:

<Aside>
semio is not another tool trying to do the same job differently. It’s a lightweight layer that connects your existing tools and workflows

:::note[Did you figure it out?]
semio is more than a tool → it's an **ecosystem** for modular design.
:::



- An **open-source ecosystem** for designing kit-of-parts architecture  🧩 
- A **designer-affine pencil** for a placeholder-based, non-linear and iterative design space exploration  🔀 
- A **collaboration-friendly platform** to design effectively in large teams  🤝 
- A **local-first storage** to link, reuse and develop design systems  🔗
- A **decentralized technology** of sharing online assets with metadata  🌐 
- An **ai-boosted design assistant**, ready for LLM super powers  🤖 
- A **razor-sharp interface** for integrating manual and automated design workflows  🏗️ 
- A **conversion-free interoperability standard** that sits on top of existing software and is not trying to get in between  🪆 
- A **ready-to-use API** for other developers 👩‍💻 



## 🧭 When to Use semio

Not every design challenge needs semio — but some do.

- If you shape expressive forms by sketching or sculpting surfaces,  
  tools like **SketchUp**, **Rhino**, or **Blender** give you creative freedom.

- If you draw floor plans, sections, and elevations line by line,  
  tools like **AutoCAD** or **Vectorworks** help you stay precise.

- If you assemble buildings from pre-defined elements like walls, doors, and roofs,  
  tools like **Revit** or **ArchiCAD** handle your BIM workflow.

- If you explore generative shapes, responsive patterns, or complex behaviors,  
  **Grasshopper**, **Houdini**, or similar tools are where you thrive.

But when your focus shifts to:

- Designing **modular systems** with logic and intention  
- Defining **kits of parts** that adapt across projects  
- Working in **teams**, where design logic needs to be shared  
- Creating designs that are **reusable, evolvable, and structured**

#### That’s where **semio** comes in.
