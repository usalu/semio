## üß© What is Semio?

Semio is a **framework** for thinking and designing in **systems**,  
not just shapes.

It‚Äôs built for **modular architecture**, where complex designs are made from  
**smart**, **reusable parts** that can adapt and grow over time.

Unlike traditional modeling tools that focus on **geometry** or **drawings**,  
Semio centers on the **logic** behind your design ‚Äî the **relationships**,  
**rules**, and **components** that define how things fit together.

By modeling **intelligence** instead of just form,  
Semio helps you **reuse**, **remix**, and **evolve** your designs  
with **clarity**, **consistency**, and **control**.



- #### Version 2 

## üß© What is Semio?

**Semio is a design system for modular architecture.**  
It helps you build with **parts** ‚Äî not just shapes.

With Semio, you design using **clear rules** and **reusable components**.  
You focus on how things **connect** and **behave**, not just how they look.

Instead of one big model, Semio lets you organize your work into **smart**, **flexible pieces**  
that can be **reused**, **rearranged**, and **scaled**.

It gives **structure** to your ideas ‚Äî so you can work faster, collaborate better,  
and make changes with **confidence**.


## ‚ùå What semio is _not_:

Semio is not another tool trying to do the same job differently.It‚Äôs a lightweight layer that connects your existing tools by focusing on logic ‚Äî not format, interface, or output.

- ü™Ü A **conversion-free interoperability standard** that sits on top of existing software and is not trying to get in between  
- üë©‚Äçüíª A **ready-to-use API** for other developers

> Semio is where **system thinking** meets **creative freedom** ‚Äî all in one connected workspace.

If you design unique atmospheres
by hand drawn sketches, eager to find the right shape based on surfaces with one-of-each-kind morphology, then you should stick to your 3d tool ‚ùå

If you design floor plans, sections and elevations
by moving lines and hatches around, analyzing contours
then you should stick to your CAD tool ‚ùå

If you design storeys, walls, windows, slabs and roofs
by moving them around, changing individual dimensions of those,
then you should stick to your BIM tool ‚ùå

If you design high-resolution blobs
by sophisticated rules, statistical noise, intersection-based entropy,
then you should stick to your solver tool ‚ùå

If you design modular systems
by iteratively developing typology based on metrics,
then you should use semio ‚úÖ
