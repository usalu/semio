## 🧩 What is Semio?

**Semio** is not just a tool ➡️ it's a new way to design architecture.

Think in **systems**, not surfaces.  
Design with **rules and relationships**, not just lines and layers.  
Build **intelligent, reusable parts** that evolve with your project.

Work as a **team**, not in silos ➡️ Semio is made for **collaborative design**, where logic can be shared, edited, and extended together.

And you're never locked in. Semio is **platform-independent** and open ➡️ it works alongside your favorite tools, not against them.

Create architecture that’s modular, adaptable, and ready to grow ➡️ from sketch to system.

  ## 🧩 What is Semio?

  Semio is a **framework** for thinking and designing in **systems**,  
  not just shapes.

  It’s built for **modular architecture**, where complex designs are made from  
  **smart**, **reusable parts** that can adapt and grow over time.

  Unlike traditional modeling tools that focus on **geometry** or **drawings**,  
  Semio centers on the **logic** behind your design — the **relationships**,  
  **rules**, and **components** that define how things fit together.

  By modeling **intelligence** instead of just form,  
  Semio helps you **reuse**, **remix**, and **evolve** your designs  
  with **clarity**, **consistency**, and **control**.

  ## 🧩 What is Semio?

  **Semio is a design system for modular architecture.**  
  It helps you build with **parts** — not just shapes.

  With Semio, you design using **clear rules** and **reusable components**.  
  You focus on how things **connect** and **behave**, not just how they look.

  Instead of one big model, Semio lets you organize your work into **smart**, **flexible pieces**  
  that can be **reused**, **rearranged**, and **scaled**.

  It gives **structure** to your ideas — so you can work faster, collaborate better,  
  and make changes with **confidence**.

  Design with **rules and relationships**, not just lines and layers.  
  Build  **intelligent parts** that evolve, not static shapes that get redrawn.

  Semio helps you create architecture that’s **modular**, **reusable**, and ready to adapt — whether you're sketching, iterating, or collaborating at scale.

## ❌ What semio is _not_:

<Aside>
Semio is not another tool trying to do the same job differently. It’s a lightweight layer that connects your existing tools and workflows

:::note[Have you figure out?]
Semio is more than a tool → it's an **ecosystem** for modular design.
:::

- 🧩 An **open-source ecosystem** for designing kit-of-parts architecture  
- 🔀 A **designer-affine pencil** for a placeholder-based, non-linear and iterative design space exploration  
- 🤝 A **collaboration-friendly platform** to design effectively in large teams  
- 🔗 A **local-first storage** to link, reuse and develop design systems  
- 🌐 A **decentralized technology** of sharing online assets with metadata  
- 🤖 An **ai-boosted design assistant**, ready for LLM super powers  
- 🏗️ A **razor-sharp interface** for integrating manual and automated design workflows  
- 🪆 A **conversion-free interoperability standard** that sits on top of existing software and is not trying to get in between  
- 👩‍💻 A **ready-to-use API** for other developers



## 🧭 When to Use Semio

Not every design challenge needs Semio — but some do.

- If you shape expressive forms by sketching or sculpting surfaces,  
  tools like **SketchUp**, **Rhino**, or **Blender** give you creative freedom.

- If you draw floor plans, sections, and elevations line by line,  
  tools like **AutoCAD** or **Vectorworks** help you stay precise.

- If you assemble buildings from pre-defined elements like walls, doors, and roofs,  
  tools like **Revit** or **ArchiCAD** handle your BIM workflow.

- If you explore generative shapes, responsive patterns, or complex behaviors,  
  **Grasshopper**, **Houdini**, or similar tools are where you thrive.

But when your focus shifts to:

- Designing **modular systems** with logic and intention  
- Defining **kits of parts** that adapt across projects  
- Working in **teams**, where design logic needs to be shared  
- Creating designs that are **reusable, evolvable, and structured**

That’s where **Semio** comes in.

:::note
Semio is not here to replace your tools — it’s here to connect them.  
To help you move from drawing outcomes to modeling systems.
