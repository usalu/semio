## 🧠 Think in Systems, Not Shapes

**Semio is a new way to design architecture** — not with lines or layers, but with logic, structure, and intention 🔁  
It helps you build modular systems, reusable parts, and shared design logic across tools and teams 🌐  
Whether you’re sketching concepts, coding interactions, or building large-scale assemblies — Semio helps you design with rules, not repetition.

---

## ✅ What Semio *Is*

Semio isn’t a single tool — it’s an ecosystem designed to make modular thinking possible across platforms, teams, and workflows 🧠  
Here’s how its core capabilities cluster:

### 🧩 System Thinking for Design

Semio helps you think in systems — not just shapes

- An **open-source ecosystem** for designing kit-of-parts architecture 🧩  
- A **designer-affine pencil** for placeholder-based, non-linear, and iterative design exploration ✏️  
- A **local-first storage** system to link, reuse, and develop modular systems 📦  



### 🤝 Collaboration-Ready Toolkit

Built for teams, not silos

- A **collaboration-friendly platform** to design effectively in large teams 🤝  
- A **system to define and reuse kits of parts** across teams ⟲  
- A **razor-sharp interface** for integrating manual and automated workflows 🏗️  

### 🔌 Integrative by Nature

Semio connects your tools, not replaces them

- A **modular design layer** that connects across tools 🔌  
- A **conversion-free interoperability standard** that sits on top of existing tools 🪆  
- A **decentralized technology** for sharing online assets with metadata 🌐  

### 🤖 Intelligence That Assists

Design-first, automation-second

- An **AI-boosted design assistant**, ready for LLM super powers 🤖  
- A **bridge between manual design and automation**, without losing creative control 🎛️  

### 📦 Developer-Friendly Infrastructure

Made with devs in mind

- A **ready-to-use API** for other developers 👩‍💻  
- An **open-source foundation** that invites extension and contribution 🌍  
- A **platform-independent layer** that works alongside existing software without interfering 🪆

Semio helps you move from sketch to system, from part to logic, from siloed work to shared design structure 🌱

## ❌ What Semio *Is Not*

Semio doesn’t replace your tools — it connects them 🔌  
Here’s how Semio fits next to what you already use:

#### 🧱 Geometry Tools
**Rhino, SketchUp, 3ds Max, Blender…**  
> Semio links 3D geometry 🍈

#### 📐 CAD Tools
**AutoCAD, DraftSight, LibreCAD…**  
> Semio links dynamic blocks 📦

#### 🧱 BIM Platforms
**Revit, ArchiCAD, Vectorworks…**  
> Semio links instances of your own types 🗿

#### 🧮 Node-Based Tools
**Grasshopper, Dynamo, Sverchok…**  
> Semio links the input with the output ⛓️

#### 📄 Data Tools
**IFC, Speckle, BHoM…**  
> Semio links design knowledge 📚

#### 🎛️ Parametric Engines
**Hypar, Viktor, Fusion…**  
> Semio links static designs 🩻

#### 🎰 Solvers
**Wasp, Monoceros, CGA…**  
> Semio links precise pieces 🪡

#### 📜 Code-Based Modelers
**OpenSCAD, CadQuery, Fornjot…**  
> Semio links ports visually 🖱️

#### ↗️ Vector Graphics
**Illustrator, Inkscape…**  
> Semio links drawings 🪙

#### ☀️ Simulation Software
**EnergyPlus, TRNSYS…**  
> Semio links models and results 🔢

#### ☁️ CDE + Cloud Infrastructure
**BIM360, Git, Nextcloud…**  
> Semio links URLs 🔗

> 💡 *Semio isn’t a file format or a new software suite — it’s a connector layer that makes modular thinking possible across all your design tools.*

## 🧱 When to Use Semio

You don’t always need Semio — but when you’re facing complexity, modularity, or collaboration at scale, it can help.

### ✅ Use Semio when:
- You’re designing a system made of repeatable or adaptable parts 🧹  
- You want to define rules, not just draw lines ✍️  
- You work in a team and need to share logic, not just files 🤝  
- You build kits, templates, or frameworks for future reuse ♻️  
- You want to automate without losing creative control 🛠️  

### ❌ Don’t use Semio when:
- You’re just sketching ideas or sculpting forms freely ✏️  
- You’re focused on a one-off design task 🧪  
- Your process is entirely linear and fixed 🔒

Version 2 :

##### 🧭 When to Use Semio

Not every design challenge needs Semio — but some do 🧠

- If you shape expressive forms by sketching or sculpting surfaces ✏️,  
tools like **SketchUp**, **Rhino**, or **Blender** give you creative freedom 🎨  

- If you draw floor plans, sections, and elevations line by line 📐,  
tools like **AutoCAD** or **Vectorworks** help you stay precise ✍️  

- If you assemble buildings from pre-defined elements like walls, doors, and roofs 🧱,  
tools like **Revit** or **ArchiCAD** handle your BIM workflow 🧾  

- If you explore generative shapes, responsive patterns, or complex behaviors 🔁,  
**Grasshopper**, **Houdini**, or similar tools are where you thrive ⚙️  

But when your focus shifts to:

- Designing **modular systems** with logic and intention 💡  
- Defining **kits of parts** that adapt across projects 🧩  
- Working in **teams**, where design logic needs to be shared 🤝  
- Creating designs that are **reusable, evolvable, and structured** ♻️  

##### That’s where **Semio** comes in 🛠️
<br />
<br />
## 📟 In One Sentence

**Semio is a system to design systems** — modular, reusable, and open by design 🛠️⟲🌐

Semio is the missing logic layer between your design tools — making modular, team-driven architecture possible 🧩🔗
