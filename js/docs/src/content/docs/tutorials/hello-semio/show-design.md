### **ðŸ”— Step 3: Creating the Design**

**Putting It All Together (Building the Design)**

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined how they connect using **Connections**, it's time to assemble them into a full Design.

ðŸ§© The `Design` component needs three main inputs:

- **Design Name** â€“ e.g. `"Spaceship"`

- **Pieces** â€“ the components you want to place

- **Connections** â€“ how these Pieces snap together

Once you've built the Design, use the **`Show Design`** component to visualize the result.

To display it properly, plug in:

- The **Design**

- The **Types** you used

- The **Objects** (representations of the Types)

âœ… That's it â€” you've built your first modular kit in semio!
