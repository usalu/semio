In your very first step into the semio workflow, we’ll start with a simple, hands-on example 🧱

We'll model the semio logo as a custom brick set and use it to explore the basic semio tools, concepts, terminologies, and workflows 🖼️

From sketch to final design, you'll learn how to break down your sketch into modular parts and lay them out — then snap everything together, just like building a LEGO model 📐

Before we jump in, we’ll take a quick look at the semio workflow and the platforms you can use to do this 🛠️

## 🛠️ Designing with Semio: Your Platform Options

semio offers two main platforms for designing your modular systems:

---

### 🦗 Grasshopper Plugin

You’ll *always start in Grasshopper*, using the *semio plugin* to model your *Brick Set* 🧱  
This is where you define all the core elements of your modular system:

- Create your *brick molds* 🧱
  - Model *Types* — the custom molds that define your bricks

<br />

- Create your *Design* 🧩
  - Place *Pieces* — the bricks you use in your design
  - Define *Connections* — the rules for how your bricks snap together 🔗

Perfect for advanced workflows, parametric logic, and integrating with existing Grasshopper setups 🧠🔧

---

### 🌐 Sketchpad

Use *Sketchpad* when you want a more visual, intuitive way to assemble designs 🎨

In Sketchpad, you can:

- Snap together *Pieces* using your predefined brick set 🧩
- Define *Connections* between ports 🔁
- ️ visually lay out and iterate on your design with speed and clarity 🖼

Ideal for early design studies, collaboration, and fast iteration

---

### 🔄 Use One or Combine Both

semio is designed to be *platform-flexible* 🔄

- You can *create kits in grasshopper* and *assemble designs in sketchpad* 🧱
- Or keep everything in grasshopper 🧩

No matter how you work, your Kits and Designs stay * reusable, and editable* across both tools ♻️

## 📝 Sketch Breakdown

Normally, you'd create your own design instructions from scratch ✍️  
But for this tutorial, we’ve provided the steps you need to follow to reach the final design 🧩

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing.png)

Your sketch is split into two parts 🖼️:

- *creating the brick molds* 🔲
- *creating your design* 🔳

Each part helps you understand a different layer of the design logic 🎯  
We’ll go through both in detail, step by step 🪜

### 🔲 Creating the Brick Molds

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-123.png)

The mission in the beginning is to look at the Logo sketch and start spotting patterns 🔍  
You’ll notice five shapes that look nearly identical — just with different lengths 📏

🧱 Think of them like LEGO bricks:  
A 2-stud brick 🟦, a 4-stud brick 🟪, and a 5-stud brick 🟥  
Same shape logic ✨ just stretched or scaled 📐

- In *step 1* 🔧 you’ll see the base shape and instructions to reach the desired outcome
  A rectangle cut at an angle ✂️ with four docking points on each side ⚓  
  That’s the blueprint for creating your custom building block 📘  
  In this step, you are creating your *Type* — the unique mold for your bricks 🧱

- In *step 2* 📏 you’ll see three repeated *Variants* of that shape:
  2️⃣, 4️⃣, and 5️⃣ units long  
  Here you’re defining the *variations* of your Type  
  Each Variant is like a different size of the same brick mold 🧱

- In *step 3* 📦 you’ll see your final casted bricks — the total number of bricks you need to create 🔢
  In this step, you are creating *Pieces*, which are instances of the Type 🧱

---

### 🔳 Assembling the Design

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-45.png)

- In *steps 4 & 5* 📐 you’ll see the final assembly of your bricks into a design
  This is where you snap them together to form your structure 🏗️

- Each number (2️⃣, 4️⃣, 5️⃣) shows *which variant* is used where 📍
- ⟶ *circles with arrows* = _ports_ ⚓ — the snap points where pieces connect ◯
- ️ *black guidelines* = _assembly instructions_ 🧭 — showing which port connects to which, and how 🔗 🖋

We’ll explain all these parts as we move step-by-step 🪜 through building the design
