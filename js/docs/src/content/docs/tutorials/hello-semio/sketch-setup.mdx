🛠️ **Platforms & Workflow in semio**

Designing in semio is split into two main stages, each supported by a dedicated platform but flexible enough to be done entirely in **Grasshopper**.

---

🧱 **1\. Creating the Brick set**

This is where you define your modular parts. Think of it like designing the Lego set:

You model **Types** (the brick templates), place **Ports** (connectors), and attach **Metadata** (semantic and design-relevant information).

✅ **Tool:**

🦗 **semio Plugin for Grasshopper**  
The plugin gives you precise control over your workflow and lets you take full advantage of Grasshopper’s parametric logic

---

🧩 **2\. Creating the Design**

This is where you snap those parts together.

You place **Pieces** (instances of Types) and define **Connections** (rules between Ports). like assembling bricks into a model.

✅ **Tools:**

🌐 **semio Studio (Online):**  
 A visual, intuitive interface for assembling Designs collaboratively. Ideal for layout, teamwork, and quick iteration.

🦗 **Grasshopper Plugin:**  
 You can also use the semio plugin for the entire process, especially when you want to leverage parametric workflows or integrate with plugins like **Wasp** or **Ladybug**, whether to generate connection logic, analyze a Design, or enrich Metadata.

---

### **🔄 Combine Both Platforms**

semio is **platform-flexible**: you can **generate Kits in Grasshopper** and **assemble Designs in Studio**, or do it all in one place.

Everything stays **linked and synced**. Kits and Designs can be reused, shared, and edited across both tools seamlessly.

# **🧩 Building Your First semio Design**

**From Sketch to Structure**

In this tutorial, you’ll walk through the process of turning a sketch into a working modular design using semio. Think of this as assembling your first LEGO model from scratch — except now, you’re the one defining the bricks.

We’ll structure each step around Semio’s core components: **Type**, **Piece**, **Port**, and **Connection**, all of which you already encountered in The Anatomy of a Modular Design System ( Think in semio )

## **👀 Step 1:📝 Sketch Breakdown**

Your sketch is split into two parts — just like a Lego instruction sheet:

#### **🔲 Top: Designing the Building Blocks**

This is the starting point of any modular design — **spotting patterns**.  
 You can spot five shapes that look almost the same, just with different sizes.

🧱 Think of them like Lego bricks: a 2-stud brick, a 4-stud brick, and a 5-stud brick.  
 Similar shape, same logic — just stretched.

That means:  
**We will have to model them as _variants_ of the same Type** (the same mold with different settings).  
 If there were different shapes — like a window or roof piece — those would count as _different_ Types.

The shape you see is a rectangle, cut at an angle — that’s your custom building block.  
 On the right, the yellow box lists the three repeated **variants** (2, 4, and 5 units long).

---

#### **🔳 Bottom: Building the Design**

This is where you see how those bricks snap together to form your structure.

- Each number (2, 4, 5) shows **which variant** is used where.

- 🔴 **Circles with arrows** = _Ports_ — the snap points where pieces connect

- 🖋️ **Black text** = _Assembly instructions_ — telling you which Port connects to which, and how

We’ll explain all these parts as we move step-by-step through building the design.
