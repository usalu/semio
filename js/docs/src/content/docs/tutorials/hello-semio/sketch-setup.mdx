In your very first step into the Semio workflow, we’ll start with a simple, hands-on example 🧱 

We'll model the Semio logo as a custom brick set and use it to explore the basic Semio tools, concepts, terminologies, and workflows 🖼️ 

From sketch to final design, you'll learn how to break down your sketch into modular parts and lay them out — then snap everything together, just like building a LEGO model 📐 

Before we jump in, we’ll take a quick look at the Semio workflow and the platforms you can use to do this 🛠️

## 🛠️ Platforms for Designing in Semio


semio offers two main platforms for designing you modular systems:

---

### 🦗 Grasshopper Plugin

You’ll **always start in Grasshopper**, using the **Semio plugin** to model your **Brick Set** 🧱  
This is where you define all the core elements of your modular system:

- 🧱 Create your **Brick Molds**
  - Model **Types** — the custom molds that define your bricks  

<br />

- 🧩 Create your **Design**
  - Place **Pieces** — the bricks you use in your design  
  - Define **Connections** — the rules for how your bricks snap together 🔗  

Perfect for advanced workflows, parametric logic, and integrating with existing Grasshopper setups 🧠🔧


---

### 🌐 Sketchpad

Use **Sketchpad** when you want a more visual, intuitive way to assemble designs 🎨

In Sketchpad, you can:

- 🧩 Snap together **Pieces** using your predefined brick set  
- 🔁 Define **Connections** between Ports  
- 🖼️ Visually lay out and iterate on your design with speed and clarity

Ideal for early design studies, collaboration, and fast iteration

---

### 🔄 Use One or Combine Both

Semio is designed to be **platform-flexible** 🔄

- 🧱 You can **create Kits in Grasshopper** and **assemble Designs in Sketchpad**  
- 🧩 Or keep everything in Grasshopper  

No matter how you work, your Kits and Designs stay ** reusable, and editable** across both tools ♻️

## 📝 Sketch Breakdown

Normally, you'd create your own design instructions from scratch ✍️  
But for this tutorial, we’ve provided the steps you need to follow to reach the final design 🧩

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing.png)


Your sketch is split into two parts 🖼️:

- 🔲 **Creating the Brick Molds** 
- 🔳 **Creating your design**

Each part helps you understand a different layer of the design logic 🎯  
We’ll go through both in detail, step by step 🪜

### 🔲 Creating the Building Blocks

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-123.png)

The first step is to look at the sketch and start spotting patterns 🔍  
You’ll notice five shapes that look nearly identical — just with different lengths 📏

🧱 Think of them like LEGO bricks:  
A 2-stud brick 🟦  A 4-stud brick 🟪  A 5-stud brick 🟥  
Same shape logic ✨ just stretched or scaled 📐

- In **Step 1** 🔧 you’ll see the base shape  
  A rectangle cut at an angle ✂️  
  That’s the blueprint of your custom building block 📘  

- In **Step 2** 📏 you’ll see three repeated **variants** of that shape  
  2️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣ units long  

- In **Step 3** 📦 you’ll see the total number of building blocks you need to create 🔢  

---

### 🔳 Assembling the Design

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-45.png)

This is where you see how those bricks snap together to form your structure 🧩

- Each number (2️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣) shows **which variant** is used where 📍  
- ◯⟶ **Circles with arrows** = _Ports_ ⚓ — the snap points where pieces connect  
- 🖋️ **Guidelines in black** = _Assembly instructions_ 🧭 — telling you which Port connects to which, and how 🔗  

We’ll explain all these parts as we move step-by-step 🪜 through building the design
