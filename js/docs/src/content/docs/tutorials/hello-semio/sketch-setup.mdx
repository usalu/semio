In the very first step of getting to know the semio workflow, we will start with a simple example.  
In this example, we will model the logo of semio as a brick set and go through and cover all the basic semio tools, terminologies, and workflows — starting from a sketch to a final design.  
First, we want to start with a brief, simplified understanding of the semio workflow and the platforms involved, to decide how and in which platform we will do this.

## 🛠️ Platforms for Designing in Semio

Semio offers two main platforms for designing modular systems:  
**Grasshopper** for systematic design and parametric control, and **Sketchpad** for fast, visual design.  
You can use either one — or combine both — depending on your workflow.

---

### 🦗 Grasshopper Plugin

You’ll **always start in Grasshopper**, using the **semio plugin** to model your Brick Set.  
This is where you define all the core elements of your system:

- 🧱 Create your **Brick Set**  
  - Model **Types** (your custom brick molds)  
  - Place **Ports** (the snap points)  
  - Attach **Semantics and Metadata** (meaningful info for your system)

---

- 🧩 Build the **Design**  
  - Place **Pieces** (your bricks)  
  - Define **Connections** (rules for how Ports link)  
  - Integrate plugins like **Wasp**, **Ladybug**, or **Human** to enrich behavior

Ideal for advanced workflows, parametric modeling, and integration into existing Grasshopper setups.

---

### 🌐 Sketchpad

Use **Sketchpad** when you want a more visual, intuitive way to assemble designs.

In Sketchpad, you can:

- 🧩 Snap together **Pieces** using your predefined brick set  
- 🔁 Define **Connections** between Ports directly in the browser  
- 🖼️ Visually lay out and iterate on your design with speed and clarity

Ideal for early design studies, collaboration, and fast iteration.

---

### 🔄 Use One or Combine Both

Semio is designed to be **platform-flexible**:

- 🧱 You can **create Kits in Grasshopper** and **assemble Designs in Sketchpad**  
- 🧩 Or keep everything in Grasshopper  
- 🖼️ Or do it all in Sketchpad (if the Kit is already made)

No matter how you work, your Kits and Designs stay **linked, reusable, and editable** across both tools.

## 📝 Sketch Breakdown

While normally you would need to create your own design instructions, we will provide you with the needed instructions and steps to follow to get to the final design.

Your sketch is split into two parts — just like a LEGO instruction sheet:

### 🔲 Designing the Building Blocks

The first step is to look at the sketch and start spotting patterns.  
You’ll notice five shapes that look nearly identical — just with different lengths.

🧱 Think of them like LEGO bricks: a 2-stud brick, a 4-stud brick, and a 5-stud brick.  
Same shape logic — just stretched or scaled.

In **step 1**, you’ll see the base shape: a rectangle cut at an angle. That’s your custom building block.  
In **step 2**, you’ll see three repeated **variants** of that shape: 2, 4, and 5 units long.


---

### 🔳 Assembling the pieces

This is where you see how those bricks snap together to form your structure.

- Each number (2, 4, 5) shows **which variant** building block is used where  
- 🔴 **Circles with arrows** = _Ports_ — the snap points where pieces connect  
- 🖋️ **Black text** = _Assembly instructions_ — telling you which Port connects to which, and how

We’ll explain all these parts as we move step-by-step through building the design.
