In your first step into the semio workflow, we start with a simple, hands-on example 🧱  
We will model the semio logo as a custom brick set and use it to explore the basic semio tools, concepts, terminologies and workflows 🖼️

From sketch to final design, you will break down your sketch into modular parts and lay them out — then snap everything together just like building a LEGO model 📐

Before we jump in, here is a quick overview of the semio workflow and the platforms you can use to do this 🛠️

---

## 🛠️ Designing with semio — your platform options

semio offers two main platforms for designing your modular systems

---

### 🦗 Grasshopper plugin

You will always start in Grasshopper using the semio plugin to model your **brick set**  
This is where you define all the core elements of your modular system

- Create your **brick molds** — model _Types_, the custom molds that define your bricks 🧱
- Create your **design** — place _Pieces_, the bricks you use in your design, and define _Connections_, the rules for how your bricks snap together 🔗

Perfect for advanced workflows, parametric logic and integrating with existing Grasshopper setups 🧠

---

### 🌐 Sketchpad

Use Sketchpad when you want a more visual and intuitive way to assemble designs  
In Sketchpad you can

- Snap together _Pieces_ using your predefined brick set 🧩
- Define _Connections_ between ports 🔁
- Visually lay out and iterate on your design with speed and clarity 🎨

Ideal for early design studies, collaboration and fast iteration

---

### 🔄 Use one or combine both

semio is platform-flexible 🔄

- You can create kits in Grasshopper and assemble designs in Sketchpad 🧱
- Or keep everything in Grasshopper 🧩

No matter how you work, your kits and designs stay reusable and editable across both tools ♻️

## 📝 Sketch breakdown

Normally you would create your own design instructions from scratch ✍️  
For this tutorial, the steps you need to reach the final design are already prepared 🧩

Your sketch is split into two parts

- Creating the brick molds 🧱
- Creating your design 🧩

Each part helps you understand a different layer of the design logic 🎯  
We will go through both in detail step by step 🪜

### 🔲 Creating the brick molds

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-123.png)

Look at the logo sketch and start spotting patterns 🔍  
You will notice five shapes that look nearly identical — just with different lengths 📏

Think of them like LEGO bricks  
A 2-stud brick, a 4-stud brick and a 5-stud brick — same shape logic ✨ just stretched or scaled 📐

In the next step, we will define these shapes as _Types_ and create their _Variants_ so they can be reused across the design
