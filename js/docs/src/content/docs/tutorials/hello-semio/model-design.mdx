🧱 This section shows how to use the brick molds you've built — your **Types** and **Variants** — to actually build something with them.

📐 As mentioned in *[Think in Semio]*, what you've made so far are just **blueprints** — molds that define the logic and shape of your bricks.  
But a mold alone isn't a brick you can snap into place.

---

## 🔖 Place Your Bricks (Model Pieces - Pcs)

🧩 Now it's time to **cast those molds** into real, usable bricks — called **Pieces**.  
🎯 These are the actual building blocks you'll place, connect, and arrange in your design.

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-piece.png)

When you model a Piece, you're telling Semio:  
🧱 *"Cast this specific version of a brick mold (a Type and its Variant) to create an actual, usable brick."*

---

Each **Piece** automatically inherits everything defined in its mold:

- 🧱 **Geometry (Representation)**  
  The shape from the Variant's assigned geometry file or model

- ⚓ **Ports**  
  The snap points and directions from the mold

- 🧠 **Semantic structure**  
  Its Type name, Variant origin (if applicable), and how it behaves or connects within the design

- 📄 **Metadata**  
  Any design-relevant info added to the Type — such as function, material, or custom properties

In other words: it carries everything you baked into the mold.

---

### 🆔 Name the Pieces

Each Piece needs a unique name — its ID — so Semio can 🧭 track, 🔗 reference, and 🧩 connect it later on.
Think of it as your brick’s personal label 🏷️

In this example, we name the Pieces based on the original Semio logo — using both color and position as references 🎨:

🟨 Yel → yellow piece on the left

🔴 Red-T → red piece at the top

🔴 Red-R → red piece on the right

🔵 Blu-T → blue piece at the top

🔵 Blu-B → blue piece at the bottom

As always in Semio, naming is flexible 🔤 —
but using a systematic and meaningful convention 🧠 helps make your design easier to understand, build, and share.


> 💡 Think of it as putting a sticker on each brick in your box so you know exactly which one goes where.

---

### 🧬 Link to the Mold

To actually model the Piece, Semio needs to know **which mold it came from**.  
You do this by linking it to a specific **Type** and **Variant**:

- 🏷️ **Type name** → e.g. `'Profile'`  
- 🔢 **Variant number** → e.g. `2`, `4`, or `5`

👉 **Without this reference**, the Piece has no shape or logic — it won't know what to look like or how to connect.


---

##### 📐 Example from the Sketch

In our example, the final **Design** includes five Pieces, built from three different Variants:

- 2× Variant 2  
- 1× Variant 4  
- 2× Variant 5

We'll give each of these Pieces a unique ID, like so:

| Variant | Piece IDs      |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `4`     | `Yel`            |
| `5`     | `Red-T`, `Red-R`     |
| `2`     | `Blu-T`, `Blu-B`     |

These are the actual bricks we'll be placing into our model.

--- 

##### **🛠️ In Grasshopper**


Now that you understand what a Piece is, let's learn how to actually **cast** them using the Semio plugin in Grasshopper.  

As shown in the image, you use the model Piece `Pce` component and provide three main inputs:

1. 🆔 **Piece IDs** — unique names for each individual brick (e.g. `Yel`, `Blu-B`)  
2. 🔢 **Variant numbers** — telling Semio which version of the mold to use (e.g. `4`, `5`)  
3. 🏷️ **Type name** — the shared name of the mold they all come from (e.g. `'Profile'`)

Each row of input becomes one new **Piece**, named after its ID — like `Pce(Yel)` or `Pce(Red-R)` —  
each inheriting geometry, ports, and semantic structure from its parent mold

🧱 Let’s start by modeling the first two Pieces from the sketch.

![Model Piece Component](/model-piece-10Alpha.png)

Once all five are complete, your model will look like this:

![Model Piece Component](/model-5pieces-10Alpha-V2.png)


> 🧱 Your bricks are now cast and ready. The next step will be placing and connecting them to build your model.

---

## 🔗 Connect the Bricks (Model Connections - Con)


Now that you've placed your Pieces, it's time to tell semio how they connect. Think of this like giving the assembly instructions for snapping bricks together 🧱🧲

Each **Connection** says:  
👉 "Connect this Port on one Piece to a Port on another Piece."

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-connections.png)

### 🔀 Set Connection




To create a connection, you need to define four key values:

1. **Connected Piece ID (CdPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping from (**From Piece**)  
2. **Connected Piece Port ID (CdPo)** – the specific port on that piece you're connecting from (**From Port**)  
3. **Connecting Piece ID (CgPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping to (**To Piece**)  
4. **Connecting Piece Port ID (CgPo)** – the specific port on the other piece you're connecting to (**To Port**)

---

**That's it! Just tell Semio:**  
**Connect this Port on this Piece → to that Port on that Piece.**

---

##### 🧩 Example: Connecting Two Pieces


🧱 Before we snap the full model together, let’s start small — by connecting the first two bricks.
We’ll connect Piece Yel to Piece Red-T, using their west-facing Ports.

From the sketch, we see:

- Use the **`w` (west)** Port of `Yel`  
- Connect it to the **`w` (west)** Port of `Red-T`

**So the connection is written as:**  
`Con(Yel:w → Red-T:w)`

![Connection Example](/mode-connection-grasshopper.png)

This tells Semio:  
**Snap the west Port of `Yel` to the west Port of `Red-T`**

![Set Connection](/set-connection-2pcs-alpha.png)

![Set Connection](/mode-connection-5pcs-grasshopper.png)

![Set Connection](/set-connection-all-pcs-alpha.png)


:::note
🔗 The number of Connections is always one less than the number of Pieces, because each Connection links two Pieces.
So with 2 Pieces, you need 1 Connection — with 3 Pieces, 2 Connections — and so on.

### 🎯 Adjust Snap *(Optional Step)*

When two Pieces are connected through Ports, Semio lets you fine-tune how the connected Piece is placed —  
not by changing the Port itself, but by shifting or rotating the geometry that comes with it.

These adjustments are relative to the orientation of the Port on the connected Piece — as originally defined in the Type (your mold).

📌 Use this when the geometry needs to land slightly beyond or offset from the Port point.

---

#### 🔁 Moving (Translation)

These are local movements based on the direction the Port was defined in:

- **Gap** → Creates a gap between two connected elements by pushing the Piece forward or backward along the Port's axis.
- **Shift** → Shifts the Piece side to side, across the plane of the Port.
  📐 Like nudging a LEGO brick left or right to align with studs underneath.
- **Raise** → Raises the Piece up or down, perpendicular to the face it connects to.
  🪜 Like lifting a brick slightly higher or lowering it onto the studs.

  ![Connection Adjustment](/translation-parameter.gif)

---


#### 🔄 Rotating (Orientation)

- **Rotate** → Rotates the Piece flat, around the Port's main vector.
  🧭 Like spinning a round LEGO tile in place.
- **Turn** → Turns the Piece sideways, rotating it horizontally.
  🔄 Like twisting a LEGO hinge side to side.
- **Tilt** → Tilts the Piece forward or backward, around a vertical axis.
  🤸 Like tilting a ramp or slope brick up or down.

  ![Connection Adjustment](/Rotation-parameter.gif)

---


As we can see, the two Pieces we connected earlier don’t align exactly as shown in the sketch 🧩

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-adjustments.png)

This is where the optional step of adjusting the snap comes in 🛠️
Here is how to use them to fine-tune the position and rotation of a Piece after it snaps.


![Set Connection](/set-connection-2pcs.gif)




---


##### ➕ Connecting the rest of the Pieces

Once i and L1 are correctly aligned, we can continue connecting the rest of the Pieces ➕
Following the sketch, each new Piece is snapped to the previous one using their matching Ports — adjusting alignment when needed
🌀 If a connected Piece isn’t oriented properly, you can simply rotate it into position. Semio allows per-piece rotation without breaking the logic
🔗 And thanks to Semio’s chain behavior, when you move or rotate one Piece, all the connected Pieces after it update automatically

![Set Connection](/set-connection-3pcs.gif)

![Set Connection](/set-connection-5pcs.gif)

---

##### 🧠 Port Placement vs. Adjustment

You can often skip manual adjustments by placing Ports **exactly where the geometry should land**  
But when working with Variants or non-aligned shapes, small transformations give you added flexibility

Keeping Port positions consistent across Variants makes your Types easier to reuse and align

> **Semio supports both strategies** — place Ports precisely, or adjust Pieces after snapping  
> 🧱 Just like LEGO: studs cover the whole surface, but you only use the ones that fit your logic


---

## 🏗️ Build the Design (Model Design - Dsn)

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined how they connect using **Connections**, it's time to assemble everything into a complete **Design** — the final model you want to build.

##### 🧩 What is a Design?

A **Design** in Semio is the full set of instructions for your model.  
It’s the final assembly where you place specific Pieces and connect them using logic — not just forming geometry, but encoding meaning and relationships.

🧱 Think of it as your finished LEGO model — built from smart bricks, arranged by intent.  
This is where everything comes together into a structured system.


---

### 🛠️ Assembling the Design

To create your Design in semio (for example, in Grasshopper), use the `Model Design` component. You'll provide three main inputs:

1. **Design Name** (Dn) : 
   Give your model a unique name, like `"Spaceship"` or `"Logo Example"`.

2. **Pieces** (Pcs) :
   Pass in the list of Pieces you've created — each one is an instance of a Variant, with its own ID.

3. **Connections** (Con) :
   Pass in the list of Connections — each one describes how two Pieces are snapped together via their Ports.

**Example:**

![Model Design Example](/model-design.png)

## ⚙️ Workflow Mechanics 

### 🛠️ Grasshopper Workflow

semio doesn’t change how Grasshopper works — it just changes **what** you’re building.

Instead of only passing geometry between components, you’re now passing structured data like:

- 🧱 **Types** (brick molds)  
- 🧩 **Pieces** (placed bricks)  
- 🔌 **Ports** and 🔗 **Connections** between them


Semio components behave just like regular Grasshopper components 🧩:

- 📋 You still use **lists** and  **data trees**  
- 🔢 Items are matched by **index** or **branch**

If you want to set something like a **gap** ↔️ or **rotation** 🔄, just provide a matching list of values:  
Each value will apply to the corresponding item in the list of Connections or Pieces 🔗

---



### 🔄 Contruct, Deconstruct, Reconstruct

In Semio, each Model component (like Model Type, Model Piece, or Model Design) outputs a special Semio parameter:

- `Ty` → a **Type** (your brick mold) 🧱  
- `Pc` → a **Piece** (a placed brick) 🧩  
- `Cn` → a **Connection** (how two bricks snap together) 🔗  
- `Ds` → a **Design** (the full assembled model) 🧰  

You can plug these outputs back into the **same component** — usually the first input — to modify or rebuild them.  
Only the parameters you redefine will be changed; all other values stay untouched.  


---


#### 🧩 Modify a Piece  

→ You can modify **any aspect** of a Piece — like its placement, name, or other construction parameters   
by feeding its `Pc` output back into a new `Model Piece` component 
semio overrides only what you redefine while keeping the rest intact.

_E.g. In the Hello Semio logo, flipping the first Piece by rotating its plane causes all connected Pieces to follow — since they’re linked._


  ![Reconstruct Piece](/reconruct-piece-2.png)

  ![Reconstruct Piece](/reconruct-piece.png)

#### 🔗 Adjust a Connection  

→ Plug the `Cn` output from the **Model Connection** component back into a new **Model Connection** component 🔁  
to **update the transformation or rotation** parameters 🔄 — Semio will override only the values you redefine, while keeping the rest untouched.


  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection.png)
  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection-2.png)
  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection-3.png)

#### 🧱 Update a Type  
→ Feed the `Ty` output from `Model Type` back into the same component to update the  
**Representations**, **Ports**, or **metadata** of a Type.  
Only the changed inputs are overwritten.

_E.g. Swapping a simplified geometry file for a detailed one, or updating tags like material or category._

---

#### 🧰 Refactor a Design  
→ Use the `Ds` output from `Model Design` as input again to update the **Design name**,  
reorganize components, or rebuild part of the structure.

_E.g. Renaming a layout or modifying how a few bricks are connected — without touching the rest._

##### 🖼️ What Happens Next?

Once you've built your Design, you can visualize it using the `Preview Design` component (see the next page). This will render your assembled model, showing all the Pieces in their correct positions and how they're connected.
