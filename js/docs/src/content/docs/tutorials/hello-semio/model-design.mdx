This section shows how to snap the pieces (your previously defined bricks) together to assemble a complete model or design.

## 🔖 Place Your Bricks (Model Pieces)
→ Drop individual elements into the design

Now that you've defined your **Types** (brick molds) and their **Variants**, it's time to place actual bricks into your **Design** 🧩. In semio, these placed components are called **Pieces**.

Each **Piece** is:
- A placed instance of a **Variant**
- It inherits everything from its parent **Type**:
  - Geometry 🧱
  - Metadata 📄
  - Ports ⚓
  - Semantic structure 🧠

### 🆔 Name Piece
To model a Piece, one of the main inputs is an **ID** → A unique name for each individual Piece (e.g. `i`, `L1`, `e1`).

### 🧬 Link Mold
The other main input is a **Reference to the Type (Mold)** → This connects the Piece to its mold. Usually, this is done by providing both:
- The **Type name** (e.g. `'Profile'`)
- The **Variant number/identifier** (e.g. `2`, `4`, `5`)

👉 **Without this reference**, the Piece has no shape or logic — it won't know what to look like or how to connect.

--- 

##### **📐 Example from the Sketch**

In our example, the final **Design** contains 5 total Pieces:
- 2× Variant 2
- 1× Variant 4
- 2× Variant 5

These are the actual elements we want to place into the model.
We'll name them like this:

| Variant | Piece IDs  |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `4`     | `i`        |
| `5`     | `L1`, `L2` |
| `2`     | `e1`, `e2` |

--- 

##### **🛠️ In Grasshopper**

To create these Pieces, you provide three things to the `Pce` component:
1. A **list of IDs**
2. A **list of Variant numbers**
3. The shared **Type name** (e.g. `'Profile'`)

Each row creates one Piece.

🧾 Output:  
You'll see items like `Pce(i)` or `Pce(L1)` — these are your ready-to-place building blocks.

## 🔗 Connect the Bricks (Model Connections)
→ Tell semio which pieces should snap together

Now that you've placed your Pieces, it's time to tell semio how they connect. Think of this like giving the assembly instructions for snapping bricks together 🧱🧲

Each **Connection** says:  
👉 "Connect this Port on one Piece to a Port on another Piece."

### 🔀 Set Connection
To create a connection, you need to define four key values:

1.  **Connected Piece ID** **(CdPc)**– the ID of the piece you're snapping *from* (**From Piece**)
2.  **Connected Piece Port ID** **(CdPo)**– the specific port on that piece you're connecting *from* (**From Port**)
3.  **Connecting Piece ID** **(CgPc)**– the ID of the piece you're snapping *to* (**To Piece**)
4.  **Connecting Piece Port ID** **(CgPo)**– the specific port on the other piece you're connecting *to* (**To Port**)

**_That's it! Just tell semio:_**
**_"Connect this Port on this Piece → to that Port on that Piece."_**

#### **_`📐 Example: Connecting Two Pieces`_**
**_`Let's walk through a simple example from the sketch:`_**
**_`We want to connect Piece i to Piece L1.`_**

**_`From the sketch:`_**
- **_`Use the w (west) Port of i`_**
- **_`Connect it to the w (west) Port of L1`_**

**_`So the connection looks like this:`_**
**_`Con(i:w → w:L1)`_**

**_`This tells semio:`_**  
**_`"Snap the west Port of i to the west Port of L1."_**

**_`It's that simple`_**

### 🎯 Adjust Snap
(Optional Step)

When two Pieces are connected through Ports, semio lets you fine-tune how the connected Piece is placed — not by changing the Port itself, but by shifting or rotating the geometry that comes with it.

These adjustments are always relative to the orientation of the Port on the connected Piece — which was originally defined in the Type (your mold).

📌 Use this when the geometry needs to land slightly beyond or offset from the Port point.

--- 

##### **_`📦 Moving (Translation)`_**
These are local movements based on the direction the Port was defined in:

- **_`Gap → Creates a gap between two connected elements by pushing the Piece forward or backward along the Port's axis.`_**
- **_`Shift → Shifts the Piece side to side, across the plane of the Port.`_**
  **_`📐 Like nudging a LEGO brick left or right to align with studs underneath.`_**
- **_`Raise → Raises the Piece up or down, perpendicular to the face it connects to.`_**
  **_`🪜 Like lifting a brick slightly higher or lowering it onto the studs.`_**

--- 

##### **_`🔁 Rotating (Orientation)`_**
You can also spin or angle the Piece around the Port's local axes:

- **_`Rotate → Rotates the Piece flat, around the Port's main vector.`_**
  **_`🧭 Like spinning a round LEGO tile in place.`_**
- **_`Turn → Turns the Piece sideways, rotating it horizontally.`_**  
  **_`🔄 Like twisting a LEGO hinge side to side.`_**
- **_`Tilt → Tilts the Piece forward or backward, around a vertical axis.`_**
  **_`🤸 Like tilting a ramp or slope brick up or down.`_**

#### **_🧠 Keep in Mind_**
**_You can often skip adjustments by placing Ports exactly where the geometry should land._**  
**_But adding small transformations gives you more flexibility — especially when working with geometries that follow the same logic, like the variants in this example. Keeping consistent Port placement across them makes the Type reusable._**

**_semio supports both strategies — there's no single "right" way._**
**_🧱 Just like Lego: studs cover the whole surface. You don't always use all of them — but they're there when needed._**

**_`Here rotate the second piece to be aligned correctly`_**

**_Connecting multiple pieces :_**

#### **_🧠 Important to Know_**
**_When you move or rotate a Piece — like the second one connected to a third —_**  
**_all connected Pieces after it will update automatically._**  
**_It works like a chain: change one link, the rest follow._**

**_For Grasshopper users, this may feel intuitive —_**  
**_but unlike Grasshopper, Semio's connections are independent of data trees._**  
**_The logic is based on explicit relationships, not list order._**

**_semio keeps your Pieces connected based on relationships — not just data order._**

#### **_🧠 Important to Know_**
**_semio doesn't change how Grasshopper works — it changes what you connect._**  
**_Instead of wiring geometry, you connect its semantic structure: Types, Ports, and Pieces._**

**_Under the hood, it behaves just like any Grasshopper component:_**  
**_you work with lists or trees, and items are matched by index or branch._**

**_Each item creates one connection._**  
**_To apply values like Gap, just feed a matching list_**

## 🏗️ Build the Final Design (Model Design)
→ Collect all connections and pieces into one structure

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined how they connect using **Connections**, it's time to assemble them into a full Design.

🧩 The `Design` component needs three main inputs:
- **Design Name** – e.g. `"Spaceship"`
- **Pieces** – the components you want to place
- **Connections** – how these Pieces snap together

Once you've built the Design, you will then visualize it (see next page).
