🧱 This section shows how to use the brick molds you've built — your **Types** and **Variants** — to actually build something with them.

📐 As mentioned in *[Think in Semio]*, what you've made so far are just **blueprints** — molds that define the logic and shape of your bricks.  
But a mold alone isn't a brick you can snap into place.

---

## 🔖 Place Your Bricks (Model Pieces - Pcs)

🧩 Now it's time to **cast those molds** into real, usable bricks — called **Pieces**.  
🎯 These are the actual building blocks you'll place, connect, and arrange in your design.

When you model a Piece, you're telling Semio:  
🧱 *"Cast this specific version of a brick mold (a Type and its Variant) to create an actual, usable brick."*

---

Each **Piece** automatically inherits everything defined in its mold:

- 🧱 **Geometry (Representation)**  
  The shape from the Variant's assigned geometry file or model

- ⚓ **Ports**  
  The snap points and directions from the mold

- 🧠 **Semantic structure**  
  Its Type name, Variant origin (if applicable), and how it behaves or connects within the design

- 📄 **Metadata**  
  Any design-relevant info added to the Type — such as function, material, or custom properties

In other words: it carries everything you baked into the mold.

---

### 🆔 Name the Piece

Each Piece also needs one more thing: a unique identity.  
You give each one an **ID** — like `i`, `L1`, or `e1` — so it can be referenced, tracked, or connected later on.

> 💡 Think of it as putting a sticker on each brick in your box so you know exactly which one goes where.

---

### 🧬 Link to the Mold

To actually model the Piece, Semio needs to know **which mold it came from**.  
You do this by linking it to a specific **Type** and **Variant**:

- 🏷️ **Type name** → e.g. `'Profile'`  
- 🔢 **Variant number** → e.g. `2`, `4`, or `5`

👉 **Without this reference**, the Piece has no shape or logic — it won't know what to look like or how to connect.


---

##### 📐 Example from the Sketch

In our example, the final **Design** includes five Pieces, built from three different Variants:

- 2× Variant 2  
- 1× Variant 4  
- 2× Variant 5

We'll give each of these Pieces a unique ID, like so:

| Variant | Piece IDs      |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `4`     | `i`            |
| `5`     | `L1`, `L2`     |
| `2`     | `e1`, `e2`     |

These are the actual bricks we'll be placing into our model.

--- 

##### **🛠️ In Grasshopper**


Now that you understand what a Piece is, let's learn how to actually **cast** them using the Semio plugin in Grasshopper.  

As shown in the image, you use the model Piece `Pce` component and provide three main inputs:

1. 🆔 **Piece IDs** — unique names for each individual brick (e.g. `i`, `L1`)  
2. 🔢 **Variant numbers** — telling Semio which version of the mold to use (e.g. `4`, `5`)  
3. 🏷️ **Type name** — the shared name of the mold they all come from (e.g. `'Profile'`)

Each row of input becomes one new **Piece**, named after its ID — like `Pce(i)` or `Pce(L1)` —  
each inheriting geometry, ports, and semantic structure from its parent mold.


> 🧱 Your bricks are now cast and ready. The next step will be placing and connecting them to build your model.

---

## 🔗 Connect the Bricks (Model Connections - Con)


Now that you've placed your Pieces, it's time to tell semio how they connect. Think of this like giving the assembly instructions for snapping bricks together 🧱🧲

Each **Connection** says:  
👉 "Connect this Port on one Piece to a Port on another Piece."

### 🔀 Set Connection

To create a connection, you need to define four key values:

1. **Connected Piece ID (CdPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping from (**From Piece**)  
2. **Connected Piece Port ID (CdPo)** – the specific port on that piece you're connecting from (**From Port**)  
3. **Connecting Piece ID (CgPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping to (**To Piece**)  
4. **Connecting Piece Port ID (CgPo)** – the specific port on the other piece you're connecting to (**To Port**)

---

**That's it! Just tell Semio:**  
**Connect this Port on this Piece → to that Port on that Piece.**

---

##### 🧩 Example: Connecting Two Pieces

Let's walk through a simple example from the sketch.  
We want to connect **Piece `i`** to **Piece `L1`** using their west-facing Ports.

From the sketch, we see:

- Use the **`w` (west)** Port of `i`  
- Connect it to the **`w` (west)** Port of `L1`

**So the connection is written as:**  
`Con(i:w → w:L1)`

This tells Semio:  
**Snap the west Port of `i` to the west Port of `L1`.**

**Simple as that.**

(Here a picture where two pieces are connected)

---

### 🎯 Adjust Snap *(Optional Step)*

When two Pieces are connected through Ports, Semio lets you fine-tune how the connected Piece is placed —  
not by changing the Port itself, but by shifting or rotating the geometry that comes with it.

These adjustments are relative to the orientation of the Port on the connected Piece — as originally defined in the Type (your mold).

📌 Use this when the geometry needs to land slightly beyond or offset from the Port point.

---

#### 🔁 Moving (Translation)

These are local movements based on the direction the Port was defined in:

- **Gap** → Creates a gap between two connected elements by pushing the Piece forward or backward along the Port's axis.
- **Shift** → Shifts the Piece side to side, across the plane of the Port.
  📐 Like nudging a LEGO brick left or right to align with studs underneath.
- **Raise** → Raises the Piece up or down, perpendicular to the face it connects to.
  🪜 Like lifting a brick slightly higher or lowering it onto the studs.

---


#### 🔄 Rotating (Orientation)

- **Rotate** → Rotates the Piece flat, around the Port's main vector.
  🧭 Like spinning a round LEGO tile in place.
- **Turn** → Turns the Piece sideways, rotating it horizontally.
  🔄 Like twisting a LEGO hinge side to side.
- **Tilt** → Tilts the Piece forward or backward, around a vertical axis.
  🤸 Like tilting a ramp or slope brick up or down.

##### 🧠 Port Placement vs. Adjustment

You can often skip manual adjustments by placing Ports **exactly where the geometry should land**.  
But when working with Variants or non-aligned shapes, small transformations give you added flexibility.

Keeping Port positions consistent across Variants makes your Types easier to reuse and align.

> **Semio supports both strategies** — place Ports precisely, or adjust Pieces after snapping.  
> 🧱 Just like LEGO: studs cover the whole surface, but you only use the ones that fit your logic.

---


##### ➕ Connecting Multiple Pieces

📏 After connecting the second Piece, you can keep building — attach the third to the second, the fourth to the third, and so on.


🌀 If a connected Piece isn't aligned properly, just rotate it into position.  
Semio allows per-piece rotation without breaking the logic.

🔗 Connections behave like a chain: when you rotate or move one Piece, all the connected Pieces that follow update automatically.


---

##### ⚙️ How Semio Fits into Grasshopper

Semio doesn't change how Grasshopper works — it changes **what** you connect.  
You're not just wiring geometry — you're building relationships between **Types, Ports, and Pieces**.

Behind the scenes:

- ✅ It works like any Grasshopper component  
- ✅ You still use lists and data trees  
- ✅ Items are matched by index or branch  
- ✅ Each list item creates one connection

To apply values like `Gap`, simply provide a matching list.  
Semio handles the rest.

---

## 🏗️ Build the Design (Model Design - Dsn)

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined how they connect using **Connections**, it's time to assemble everything into a complete **Design** — the final model you want to build.

##### 🧩 What is a Design?

A **Design** in Semio is the full set of instructions for your model.  
It’s the final assembly where you place specific Pieces and connect them using logic — not just forming geometry, but encoding meaning and relationships.

🧱 Think of it as your finished LEGO model — built from smart bricks, arranged by intent.  
This is where everything comes together into a structured system.


---

### 🛠️ Assembling the Design

To create your Design in semio (for example, in Grasshopper), use the `Model Design` component. You'll provide three main inputs:

1. **Design Name** (Dn) : 
   Give your model a unique name, like `"Spaceship"` or `"Logo Example"`.

2. **Pieces** (Pcs) :
   Pass in the list of Pieces you've created — each one is an instance of a Variant, with its own ID.

3. **Connections** (Con) :
   Pass in the list of Connections — each one describes how two Pieces are snapped together via their Ports.

**Example:**
```
Design(
  Name: "Logo Example",
  Pieces: [i, L1, L2, e1, e2],
  Connections: [Con(i:w → w:L1), Con(L1:e → w:L2), ...]
)
```

---

##### 🖼️ What Happens Next?

Once you've built your Design, you can visualize it using the `Show Design` component (see the next page). This will render your assembled model, showing all the Pieces in their correct positions and how they're connected.
