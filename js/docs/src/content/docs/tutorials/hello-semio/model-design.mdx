🧱 This section shows how to use the brick molds you’ve built — your **Types** and **Variants** — to actually build something with them.

📐 As mentioned in *[Think in Semio]*, what you’ve made so far are just **blueprints** — molds that define the logic and shape of your bricks.  
But a mold alone isn’t a brick you can snap into place.

---

## 🔖 Place Your Bricks (Model Pieces)

🧩 Now it’s time to **cast those molds** into real, usable bricks — called **Pieces**.  
🎯 These are the actual building blocks you’ll place, connect, and arrange in your design.

When you model a Piece, you're telling Semio:  
🧱 *“Cast this specific version of a brick mold (a Type and its Variant) to create an actual, usable brick.”*

---

Each **Piece** automatically inherits everything defined in its mold:

- 🧱 **Geometry (Representation)**  
  The shape from the Variant’s assigned geometry file or model

- ⚓ **Ports**  
  The snap points and directions from the mold

- 🧠 **Semantic structure**  
  Its Type name, Variant origin (if applicable), and how it behaves or connects within the design

- 📄 **Metadata**  
  Any design-relevant info added to the Type — such as function, material, or custom properties

In other words: it carries everything you baked into the mold.

---

### 🆔 Name the Piece

Each Piece also needs one more thing: a unique identity.  
You give each one an **ID** — like `i`, `L1`, or `e1` — so it can be referenced, tracked, or connected later on.

> 💡 Think of it as putting a sticker on each brick in your box so you know exactly which one goes where.

---

### 🧬 Link to the Mold

To actually model the Piece, Semio needs to know **which mold it came from**.  
You do this by linking it to a specific **Type** and **Variant**:

- 🏷️ **Type name** → e.g. `'Profile'`  
- 🔢 **Variant number** → e.g. `2`, `4`, or `5`

👉 **Without this reference**, the Piece has no shape or logic — it won't know what to look like or how to connect.


---

##### 📐 Example from the Sketch

In our example, the final **Design** includes five Pieces, built from three different Variants:

- 2× Variant 2  
- 1× Variant 4  
- 2× Variant 5

We’ll give each of these Pieces a unique ID, like so:

| Variant | Piece IDs      |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `4`     | `i`            |
| `5`     | `L1`, `L2`     |
| `2`     | `e1`, `e2`     |

These are the actual bricks we’ll be placing into our model.

##### **🛠️ In Grasshopper**

##### 🛠️ How to Cast Pieces in Grasshopper

Now that you understand what a Piece is, let’s learn how to actually **cast** them using the Semio plugin in Grasshopper.  

As shown in the image, you use the model Piece `Pce` component and provide three main inputs:

1. 🆔 **Piece IDs** — unique names for each individual brick (e.g. `i`, `L1`)  
2. 🔢 **Variant numbers** — telling Semio which version of the mold to use (e.g. `4`, `5`)  
3. 🏷️ **Type name** — the shared name of the mold they all come from (e.g. `'Profile'`)

Each row of input becomes one new **Piece**, named after its ID — like `Pce(i)` or `Pce(L1)` —  
each inheriting geometry, ports, and semantic structure from its parent mold.


> 🧱 Your bricks are now cast and ready. The next step will be placing and connecting them to build your model.

---

## 🔗 Connect the Bricks (Model Connections)
→ Tell semio which pieces should snap together

Now that you've placed your Pieces, it's time to tell semio how they connect. Think of this like giving the assembly instructions for snapping bricks together 🧱🧲

Each **Connection** says:  
👉 "Connect this Port on one Piece to a Port on another Piece."

### 🔀 Set Connection
To create a connection, you need to define four key values:

1.  **Connected Piece ID (CdPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping from (**From Piece**)
2.  **Connected Piece Port ID (CdPo)** – the specific port on that piece you're connecting from (**From Port**)
3.  **Connecting Piece ID (CgPc)** – the ID of the piece you're snapping to (**To Piece**)
4.  **Connecting Piece Port ID (CgPo)** – the specific port on the other piece you're connecting to (**To Port**)

**That's it! Just tell semio:**
**Connect this Port on this Piece → to that Port on that Piece.**

#### **Example: Connecting Two Pieces**
**Let's walk through a simple example from the sketch:**
**We want to connect Piece i to Piece L1.**

**From the sketch:**
- **Use the w (west) Port of i**
- **Connect it to the w (west) Port of L1**

**So the connection looks like this:**
**Con(i:w → w:L1)**

**This tells semio:**
**Snap the west Port of i to the west Port of L1.**

**It's that simple**

### 🎯 Adjust Snap
(Optional Step)

When two Pieces are connected through Ports, semio lets you fine-tune how the connected Piece is placed — not by changing the Port itself, but by shifting or rotating the geometry that comes with it.

These adjustments are always relative to the orientation of the Port on the connected Piece — which was originally defined in the Type (your mold).

📌 Use this when the geometry needs to land slightly beyond or offset from the Port point.

---

##### **Moving (Translation)**
These are local movements based on the direction the Port was defined in:

- **Gap** → Creates a gap between two connected elements by pushing the Piece forward or backward along the Port's axis.
- **Shift** → Shifts the Piece side to side, across the plane of the Port.
  📐 Like nudging a LEGO brick left or right to align with studs underneath.
- **Raise** → Raises the Piece up or down, perpendicular to the face it connects to.
  🪜 Like lifting a brick slightly higher or lowering it onto the studs.

---

##### **Rotating (Orientation)**
You can also spin or angle the Piece around the Port's local axes:

- **Rotate** → Rotates the Piece flat, around the Port's main vector.
  🧭 Like spinning a round LEGO tile in place.
- **Turn** → Turns the Piece sideways, rotating it horizontally.
  🔄 Like twisting a LEGO hinge side to side.
- **Tilt** → Tilts the Piece forward or backward, around a vertical axis.
  🤸 Like tilting a ramp or slope brick up or down.

#### **Keep in Mind**
You can often skip adjustments by placing Ports exactly where the geometry should land.
But adding small transformations gives you more flexibility — especially when working with geometries that follow the same logic, like the variants in this example. Keeping consistent Port placement across them makes the Type reusable.

**semio supports both strategies — there's no single "right" way.**
🧱 Just like Lego: studs cover the whole surface. You don't always use all of them — but they're there when needed.

**Here rotate the second piece to be aligned correctly**

**Connecting multiple pieces:**

#### **Important to Know**
When you move or rotate a Piece — like the second one connected to a third —
all connected Pieces after it will update automatically.
It works like a chain: change one link, the rest follow.

For Grasshopper users, this may feel intuitive —
but unlike Grasshopper, Semio's connections are independent of data trees.
The logic is based on explicit relationships, not list order.

**semio keeps your Pieces connected based on relationships — not just data order.**

#### **Important to Know**
semio doesn't change how Grasshopper works — it changes what you connect.
Instead of wiring geometry, you connect its semantic structure: Types, Ports, and Pieces.

Under the hood, it behaves just like any Grasshopper component:
you work with lists or trees, and items are matched by index or branch.

Each item creates one connection.
To apply values like Gap, just feed a matching list

## 🏗️ Build the Final Design (Model Design)
→ Collect all connections and pieces into one structure

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined how they connect using **Connections**, it's time to assemble them into a full Design.

🧩 The `Design` component needs three main inputs:
- **Design Name** – e.g. `"Spaceship"`
- **Pieces** – the components you want to place
- **Connections** – how these Pieces snap together

Once you've built the Design, you will then visualize it (see next page).
