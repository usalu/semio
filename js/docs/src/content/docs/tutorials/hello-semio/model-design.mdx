This section shows how to **turn your brick molds** — the **Types** and **Variants** you’ve defined — into real, usable building blocks 🧱

As explained in *[Think in Semio]*, a Type is just a **blueprint**. It defines how a brick should look and behave — but it’s not a brick yet 📐

To actually build a design, you need to create **Pieces** — the bricks made from your molds, ready to place, connect, and assemble 🧩

---

## 🔖 Place Your Bricks (Model Pieces – Pcs)

Now it’s time to **turn your molds into actual bricks** — called **Pieces** 🧩  
These are the elements you’ll place, move, and connect in your design 🎯

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-piece.png)

When you create a Piece, you're telling Semio:  
*"Take this specific mold (Type + Variant) and make a real, usable brick from it."* 🧱

---

Each **Piece** automatically includes everything from its mold:

- **Geometry (Representation)** — the shape defined by the Variant’s geometry file 🧱  
- **Ports** — the snap points and their directions from the Type ⚓  
- **Semantic Data** — the Type name, Variant identity, and design role 🧠  
- **Metadata** — any extra info like function, material, or tags 📄  

In short: a Piece is a fully formed brick, based on the rules and shape you defined earlier 🔁

---

### 🆔 Name the Pieces

Each Piece needs a unique name — its ID — so Semio can 🧭 track, 🔗 reference, and 🧩 connect it later on.
Think of it as giving your brick a personal label 🏷️

In this example, we name the Pieces based on the Semio logo — using both **color** and **position** for clarity 🎨

- 🟨 `Yel` → yellow piece on the left  
- 🔴 `Red-T` → red piece at the top  
- 🔴 `Red-R` → red piece on the right  
- 🔵 `Blu-T` → blue piece at the top  
- 🔵 `Blu-B` → blue piece at the bottom  

As always in Semio, naming is flexible 🔤  
But a clear and consistent system makes your design easier to understand, build, and share 🧠

> 💡 It’s like putting a sticker on each LEGO brick so you always know which one goes where 🧱

---

### 🧬 Link to the Mold

To model a Piece, Semio needs to know **which mold it’s made from** 🔗  
That means linking it to a specific **Type** and **Variant**:

- 🏷️ **Type name** → e.g. `'Profile'`  
- 🔢 **Variant number** → e.g. `2`, `4`, or `5`  

👉 Without this reference, the Piece has no identity — it won’t know what shape to take or how to connect ⚠️

---

##### 📐 Example from the Sketch

In our example, the final **Design** includes five Pieces, built from **three different Variants**:

- 2× Variant `2`  
- 1× Variant `4`  
- 2× Variant `5`  

We'll give each of these Pieces a **unique ID**, like so:

| Variant | Piece IDs            |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| `4`     | `Yel`                |
| `5`     | `Red-T`, `Red-R`     |
| `2`     | `Blu-T`, `Blu-B`     |

These are the **actual bricks** you'll be placing into your model 🧱

---

##### 🛠️ In Grasshopper

Now that you understand what a Piece is, let's learn how to **cast them** using the Semio plugin in **Grasshopper** 🦗

As shown in the image, you’ll use the **Model Piece `Pce` component** and provide three key inputs:

1. 🆔 **Piece IDs** → Unique names for each brick (e.g. `Yel`, `Blu-B`)  
2. 🔢 **Variant Numbers** → Tell Semio which Variant of the mold to use (e.g. `2`, `5`)  
3. 🏷️ **Type Name** → The shared name of the mold (e.g. `'Profile'`)

Each row becomes a new **Piece**, named by its ID — like `Pce(Yel)` or `Pce(Red-R)` —  
each one inherits geometry, ports, and semantic logic from its **Type** and **Variant** 🔁

🧱 Let’s start by modeling the first two Pieces from the sketch

![Model Piece Component](/model-piece-10Alpha.png)

Once all five Pieces are created, your model will look like this:

![Model Piece Component](/model-5pieces-10Alpha-V2.png)

> ✅ Your bricks are now cast and ready  
> Next step: **placing and connecting them** to build your final model 🔗


---

## 🔗 Connect the Bricks (Model Connections - Con)

Now that you've placed your **Pieces**, it's time to tell Semio how they connect 🔗  
Think of this like writing the **assembly instructions** for snapping bricks together 🧲

Each **Connection** says:  
👉 *"Connect this Port on one Piece to a Port on another Piece"*
<br />

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-connections.png)


### 🧭 Set the Connection

To create a connection, you need to define four values:

1. 🆔 **Connected Piece ID (`CdPc`)** → the Piece you're connecting *from*  
2. ⚓ **Connected Piece Port ID (`CdPo`)** → the Port you're connecting *from*  
3. 🆔 **Connecting Piece ID (`CgPc`)** → the Piece you're connecting *to*  
4. ⚓ **Connecting Piece Port ID (`CgPo`)** → the Port you're connecting *to*

---

Put simply:  
➡️ **Connect this Port on this Piece → to that Port on that Piece**


---

##### 🧩 Example: Connecting Two Pieces

🧱 Before snapping the full model together, let’s start small — by connecting the **first two bricks**.  
We’ll connect Piece `Yel` to Piece `Red-T`, using their **west-facing Ports**.

From the sketch, we can tell:

- Use the **`w` (west)** Port of `Yel`  
- Connect it to the **`w` (west)** Port of `Red-T`

So the connection looks like this: 
`Con(Yel:w → Red-T:w)`

![Connection Example](/mode-connection-grasshopper.png)

This tells Semio:  
**Snap the west Port of `Yel` to the west Port of `Red-T`**

![Set Connection](/set-connection-2pcs-alpha.png)

Once this first connection is in place, you can continue snapping all remaining bricks together using similar logic 🧩 

![Set Connection](/mode-connection-5pcs-grasshopper.png)

🔗 This Tells Semio:


1. `Con(Yel:w → w:Red-T)`  
   👉 **Snap the west Port of `Yel`** to the **west Port of `Red-T`**

2. `Con(Red-T:e → e:Red-R)`  
   👉 **Snap the east Port of `Red-T`** to the **east Port of `Red-R`**

3. `Con(Red-R:n → w:Blu-T)`  
   👉 **Snap the north Port of `Red-R`** to the **west Port of `Blu-T`**

4. `Con(Red-R:n → w:Blu-B)`  
   👉 **Snap the north Port of `Red-R`** to the **west Port of `Blu-B`**

---


![Set Connection](/set-connection-all-pcs-alpha.png)



### 🎯 Adjust Snap *(Optional Step)*

When two Pieces are connected through Ports, Semio gives you control over **how the attached geometry is positioned** —  
without changing the Port itself.

These adjustments are applied **relative to the orientation of the Port**, based on how it was defined in the mold (Type).

📌 Use this when the geometry needs to be slightly offset — to float, shift, or align more precisely.

---

#### 🔁 Move (Translation)

You can move the geometry in three local directions:

- **Gap** ⬅️➡️ → Creates a space between two connected elements by pushing the Piece forward or backward along the Port's axis 
  Ideal for separating elements or creating breathing room between parts

- **Shift** ↔️ → Moves the Piece side to side, across the plane of the Port  
  📐 Like nudging a LEGO brick left or right to line it up with studs underneath

- **Raise** ⬆️⬇️ → Lifts or lowers the Piece vertically, perpendicular to the face it connects to  
  🪜 Like lifting a brick slightly higher or lowering it onto the studs
  

  ![Connection Adjustment](/translation-parameter.gif)

---


#### 🔄 Rotating (Orientation)

- **Rotate** 🔃  → Rotates the Piece flat, around the Port's main vector
  🧭 Like spinning a round LEGO tile in place
- **Turn** 🔄 → Turns the Piece sideways, rotating it horizontally
  🌀 Like twisting a LEGO hinge side to side
- **Tilt** 🤸 → Tilts the Piece forward or backward, around a vertical axis
  🎢 Like tilting a ramp or slope brick up or down

  ![Connection Adjustment](/Rotation-parameter.gif)

---


As we can see, the two Pieces we connected earlier don’t align exactly as shown in the sketch 🧩
<br />
![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-45.png)
<br />
This is where the optional step of adjusting the snap comes in 🛠️

Semio lets you fine-tune the position of a connected Piece after snapping 🧲  
You’re not changing the Port itself ⚓  
Instead, you're offsetting the **geometry** that comes with it 📐

<br />
![Set Connection](/set-connection-2pcs.gif)




---


##### ➕ Connecting the Rest of the Pieces

Once `i` and `L1` are correctly aligned ➡️  
you can continue connecting the remaining Pieces one by one ➕

📌 Just follow the sketch:  
Each new Piece is snapped to the previous one using their matching **Ports** ⚓  
— and adjusted as needed to match the layout.

🌀 If a connected Piece isn’t facing the right way,  
you can **rotate it individually** — Semio allows per-piece rotation without breaking the connection logic 🔄

🔗 And thanks to Semio’s **chain behavior**,  
when you move or rotate one Piece, all the connected Pieces after it will **update automatically** 💫


![Set Connection](/set-connection-3pcs.gif)

![Set Connection](/set-connection-5pcs.gif)

---

:::note
📌 You can place Ports exactly where the geometry should land — or adjust the Piece after snapping using Gap, Shift, Raise, or Rotate.  
emio supports both strategies — choose what fits your design logic best 🧱✨

## 🏗️ Build the Design (Model Design - Dsn)

Now that you've created your **Pieces** and defined their **Connections**, it's time to bring them all together into a final **Design** 🧰


### 🧩 What is a Design?



A **Design** in Semio is your full model — created by snapping together specific **Pieces** 🧱 using their **Connections** 🔗

It doesn’t just describe geometry 👁️ — it defines how each part fits, aligns, and works within the system 🧠  
You're building not just a shape, but a **smart, modular structure** 🧬

🧱 Think of it like a finished LEGO build:  
You’re not just stacking bricks — you’re creating a model where every part has a **role** 🎭, a **position** 📍, and a **purpose** 🎯



---

### 🛠️ Assembling the Design

To build your Design in Semio (e.g. in Grasshopper), you’ll use the `Model Design` component.  
This is where you **bring together all the Pieces and Connections** to form your complete model 🧩

You’ll provide three main inputs:

1. **Design Name** (`Dn`) 🏷️  
   A unique name for your model — like `"Logo Example"` or `"Spaceship"`.

2. **Pieces** (`Pcs`) 🧱  
   A list of the Pieces you’ve created — each one linked to a Type, Variant, and unique ID.

3. **Connections** (`Con`) 🔗  
   A list of the snapping rules — telling Semio how the Pieces are connected through their Ports.

---


**Example:**

## ⚙️ Workflow Mechanics 


Now that we've covered the core concepts of Semio, let's take a closer look at how the components actually work —  
and explore the key features of the Semio workflow inside Grasshopper

### 🛠️ Grasshopper Workflow

Semio doesn’t change **how** Grasshopper works — it changes **what** you’re working with.  
You’re no longer just wiring geometry — you’re wiring **design intent** 💡

- **Types** 🧱 – Brick molds with meaning, not just shapes  
- **Pieces** 🧩 – Placed bricks that follow system logic  
- **Connections** 🔗 – Rules that control how elements relate  
- **Designs** 🧰 – Full assemblies of smart, connected pieces

This shift lets you create not just geometry — but structured, adaptable systems 🧠

---

Semio components behave just like regular Grasshopper components 🧩

- 📋 You still work with **lists** and **data trees**  
- 🔢 Items are matched by **index** or **branch**

Want to set a **gap** ⬅️➡️ or a **rotation** 🔁?  
Just provide a matching list of values — each one applies to the corresponding item in your list of **Connections** or **Pieces**.

---


---



### 🔄 Contruct, Deconstruct, Reconstruct


In Semio, **Model components** like `Model Type`, `Model Piece`, `Model Connection`, and `Model Design` follow a shared logic:  
they’re not just builders — they’re also **editors** and **inspectors**.

Each component supports three fundamental actions:

---

##### 1. 🔨 Construct

Each Model component can **create** a structured Semio object from your inputs:

- `Model Type` → outputs a `Ty` (Type)
- `Model Piece` → outputs a `Pc` (Piece)
- `Model Connection` → outputs a `Cn` (Connection)
- `Model Design` → outputs a `Ds` (Design)

These are Semio’s core data types — they carry geometry, logic, metadata, and relationships.

---

##### 2. 🔍 Deconstruct

You can also use the same component to **inspect** or **extract** the inner structure of a Semio object, and all its inputs will populate with the current values, like unpacking a brick to see how it was made.

---

##### 3. 🔁 Reconstruct / Modify

In Semio, you can update any modeled object — like a Type, Piece, Connection, or Design —  
by feeding its output back into the **first input** of the same Model component.

- `Ty` → Type 🧱  
- `Pc` → Piece 🧩  
- `Cn` → Connection 🔗  
- `Ds` → Design 🧰  

When you do this, you can redefine any part of the object (like its name, geometry, plane, or metadata).  
Only the inputs you change will be updated — everything else stays exactly as it was

---
### 🧪 Example Use Case
<br />

#### 🧩 Modify a Piece

You can modify **any aspect** of a Piece — such as its **name**, **placement**, or other construction parameters by feeding its `Pc` output back into a new `Model Piece` component 🧩

Semio will only override the inputs you change — everything else stays exactly the same 🎯

> _E.g. In the "Hello Semio" logo example, rotating the first Piece flips all connected Pieces as well — because they’re linked logically_  
_


  ![Reconstruct Piece](/reconruct-piece-2.png)

  ![Reconstruct Piece](/reconruct-piece.png)

#### 🔗 Adjust a Connection

You can adjust any **transformation or rotation parameters** of a Connection by  
plugging the `Cn` output back into a new `Model Connection` component 🔁

Semio will only update the values you change — all other settings will remain as they were 🔒  
This makes it easy to fine-tune how two Pieces are connected without rebuilding the whole logic 🔧

> _E.g. You can change the gap, shift, or rotation of an existing Connection, and all downstream geometry will update automatically._



  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection.png)
  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection-2.png)
  ![Reconstruct Con](/reconstruct-connection-3.png)

#### 🧱 Update a Type

You can update a **Type** by feeding its `Ty` output back into the same `Model Type` component 🔁  
This lets you modify its **Representation**, **Ports**, or **metadata** — without changing anything else.

> _E.g. Swapping a simplified geometry file for a detailed one, or updating tags like material or category._


---

#### 🧰 Refactor a Design

To modify a full **Design**, feed its `Ds` output into a new `Model Design` component 🔁  
You can update the **Design name**, reorganize the structure, or tweak how certain Pieces are connected.

> _E.g. Renaming a layout, replacing a few bricks, or adjusting a connection — without touching the rest._

---

#### 🖼️ What Happens Next?

To **see** your model, plug everything into the `Preview Design` component 👀  
It displays all your Pieces in place — fully connected, correctly oriented, and ready to go 🧱


:::note
In Semio, nothing is visualized automatically

This logic stays abstract until you pass it to the `Show Design` component —  
only then is everything **combined and visualized** as a complete model
