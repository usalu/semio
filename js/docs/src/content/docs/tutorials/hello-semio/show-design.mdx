## 🔍 From Logic to Look

Once you've done the following:

1️⃣ _Placed your Bricks_ – by defining _Pieces_ (instances of your brick molds)
2️⃣ _Snapped them together_ – by setting up _Connections_ between their Ports
3️⃣ _Organized the build_ – by assembling them into a full _Design_

🎉 It’s time to _see your LEGO model come to life_!

Up to now, we’ve been working behind the scenes 🛠️
We’ve been defining meaning, relationships, and structure — not just drawing shapes

But unlike regular Grasshopper workflows, semio doesn’t preview geometry automatically ⚠️ The visualization happens in a dedicated step 🎬 like revealing your finished LEGO model after following all the instructions

## 🧩 Visualize the Design

Once your modular system is ready, it’s time to see it come together!
To visualize the final assembly, semio uses the `Preview Design` component in Grasshopper

🔌 _Connect these inputs to the `Preview Design` component_:

- _🧱 Design_
  The complete structure — tells semio which Pieces are used and how they’re connected

- _📦 Types_
  The brick molds used in the Design — including Ports and logic for snapping

- _🧊 Representations_
  The geometry files (e.g `.glb`) or `Objects` for each Type and Variant — the actual shape of each brick

---

🔍 Once connected, the `Preview Design` component renders your full modular creation:
brick by brick, just like snapping together your final LEGO model on the table! 🧩

Here’s what gets visualized:

- _Brick Placement_ 🧱
  Every Piece is shown in its final position — exactly where your Design logic places it

- _Port Connections_ 🧲
  All _Ports_ are displayed — including their direction — so you can clearly see how Pieces are designed to snap together, and which ones are actually connected

- _Snapping Adjustments_ 🔄
  Rotations, gaps, shifts, or tilts added during connection are shown — making alignment easy to check

✅ That’s it — you’ve built and visualized your first modular kit in semio!
From mold to model, every part now fits where it belongs
