## 🔍 From Logic to Look 

Once you've done the following:

1️⃣ **Placed your Bricks** – by defining **Pieces** (instances of your brick molds)  
2️⃣ **Snapped them together** – by setting up **Connections** between their Ports  
3️⃣ **Organized the build** – by assembling them into a full **Design**

🎉 It’s time to **see your LEGO model come to life**!

Up to now, we’ve been working behind the scenes 🛠️ defining meaning, relationships, and structure.  
But unlike regular Grasshopper workflows, Semio doesn’t preview the geometry automatically ⚠️  
🧩 That happens in a dedicated step 🎬 just like revealing your finished LEGO build after following all the instructions.


## 🧩 Visualize the Design

Once your modular system is ready, it’s time to see it come together!  
To visualize the final assembly, Semio uses the `Preview Design` component in Grasshopper.

🔌 **Connect these inputs to the `Preview Design` component**:

- **🧱 Design**  
  The complete structure — tells Semio which Pieces are used and how they’re connected.

- **📦 Types**  
  The brick molds used in the Design — including Ports and logic for snapping.

- **🧊 Representations**  
  The geometry files (e.g. `.glb`) or `Objects` for each Type and Variant — the actual shape of each brick.

🔍 Once connected, the `Preview Design` component renders your full modular creation:  
brick by brick, just like snapping together your final LEGO model on the table! 🧩

Here’s what gets visualized:

- 🧱 **Brick Placement**  
  Every Piece is shown in its final position — exactly where your Design logic places it.

- 🧲 **Port Connections**  
  Only the **connected Ports** are displayed — including their direction — so you can confirm how Pieces are snapped together

- 🔄 **Snapping Adjustments**  
  Rotations, gaps, shifts, or tilts added during connection are shown — making alignment easy to check.

✅ That’s it — you’ve built and visualized your first modular kit in Semio!  
From mold to model, every part now fits where it belongs. 🧠🧱🎉
