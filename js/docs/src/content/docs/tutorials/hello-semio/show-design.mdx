‚Üí How to visualize it using the `Show Design` component

Once you have:
1. Defined your **Pieces** (instances of your brick molds)
2. Established **Connections** between these Pieces
3. Assembled them into a `Design` structure

The next step is to see your creation!

In semio, you use the `Show Design` component (or a similar visualization function in semio Studio) to render your final model.

To properly display your Design, you typically need to provide the following to the visualization component:

- The **`Design`** itself: This contains all the information about which Pieces are used and how they are connected.
- The **`Types`** used in the Design: This tells semio the definition of each brick mold, including its Ports.
- The **Geometry/Representations** for each Type/Variant: This provides the actual visual shapes for each Piece.

Plug these inputs into the `Show Design` component, and semio will render your complete modular assembly.

‚úÖ That's it ‚Äî you've built and visualized your first modular kit in semio!
