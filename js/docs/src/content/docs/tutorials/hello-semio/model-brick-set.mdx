As mentioned earlier in **[Thinking in Semio](/think-in-semio/)**,  
A **Type** is your brick mold 🧱 The Blueprint behind each Brick  
It defines not just the shape, but also the design meaning and connection logic 🔧


---

##### 🧩 What Are the "Molds" in This Example?

Take a look at your sketch 👀  
You'll see five elements that follow the **same basic shape**, just stretched to different lengths 📏

Even though the final Design includes five Pieces, they're made from only **three distinct shapes**  
with two of them used twice — giving us **three Variants of one Type** 🔢

🧱 Think of it like a LEGO brick that comes in 2-stud, 4-stud, and 5-stud versions —  
same shape logic, just scaled 📐

If the shape were completely different — like a triangle, window, or roof ⛰️🪟🏠  
That would count as a **new Type** altogether

---

##### 🧠 Modeling with Meaning


When you think of a mold, the first thing that comes to mind is usually its **shape** — the geometry 🧱✏️  
But in Semio, the **mold** is what combines **shape** with **meaningful design information** 💡

In traditional Grasshopper workflows, you’re modeling with **raw data** — points, curves, and surfaces without embedding **design intent** 🧬  
You build logic around it, but that logic stays detached — abstract, custom, and often fragile.

> In **Semio**, the mold connects geometry with design intent directly 🧠  
> You're not referencing arbitrary geometry — you're referencing **relationships**, **roles**, and **rules** 🧩

For example:  
👉 Instead of saying "connect point (x, y, z) to Brep edge 23"  
👉 You say "connect the **door** to the **living room**" 🛋️🚪  
👉 Or in LEGO terms: "🪟 **snap the window brick onto the top of the wall**" 🧱

This is what gives Semio its strength — you’re not just building shapes,  
you’re building a **semantic system** that adapts, scales, and speaks your design language 🎯🗣️

---

## 🧰 Create a Brick Mold ([Type](/think-in-semio/#type) – Ty)

Let’s begin by modeling the mold shown in the sketch  
This will serve as the base for generating its **Variants** 🧩

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-mold.png)

Before we start building, let’s go over the essential elements that define a **Type** 🧱:

- 🏷️ **Name** → A unique name to identify your Type and reuse it in different designs  
- 🧱 **Geometry (Representation)** → The 3D shape attached to the Type — it gives the piece its visual form ✨  
- 🧲 **Connection Points (Ports)** → The snap points where the piece connects to others in the system 🔗

Now let’s take a closer look at how these elements come together — and start modeling our first **brick mold** 🛠️



<Steps>
<ol>

<li>

### 🏷️ Name Your Mold ([Type](/think-in-semio/#type) Name - Na)

Clear, consistent names in Semio make everything easier down the line ✅  
Especially when your project grows and you're working with many **Types**, **Variants**, and **Pieces** 🔄

Good names help you:

- 🧭 **Navigate** your system  
- 🔍 **Understand** relationships  
- 🔗 **Make connections** that are easy to track

:::note
Use names you'd use in a real project — specific, descriptive, and purposeful 📝 
:::

👉 In our example, we’ll name our Type **"Profile"**  
because the shape we're modeling is based on a **standard manufactured wood profile** 🪵


---

</li>

<li>

### 🧊 Attach Geometry (Representation – Rp)

In Semio, the process of adding geometry to a Type is called **modeling its Representation** 🛠️
A **Representation** is anything that visually or symbolically **represents a Type** 🧱
It helps you **see or recognize** the Type — without defining its logic or behavior 🧠

In most cases, this will be a **3D geometry**, like in our example
But it can also be:

- A 2D drawing or diagram ✏️  
- A symbolic icon or block 🔳  
- A label, file, or reference 🔖

💡 Because Representations are separate from the logic of the system, they’re fully flexible:

- You can start modeling your system without one 🚧  
- You can add or update it later 🛠️  
- You can switch between levels of detail depending on the design phase 🔍

In this example, we’ll use a **simple 3D shape** to represent our brick molds we need to create 🧩


---

##### 🔧 Modeling Representation

There are two simple steps to create a **Representation**:

- 🛠️ **Build the Geometry**  
  Model the physical form of your brick — the shape that will appear in your design

- 📎 **Link it to the Type**  
  Connect the geometry to a specific Type, so Semio knows how to display and use it in your design space


Let’s take a closer look at the **brick mold** in our example 👀  
It always follows the **same basic shape** 🧱  
A **rectangle that’s cut at an angle** ✂️ — just repeated in different lengths 📏  

As we saw in the sketch, its size is described using **two parameters**:

- `W` → the width of one brick unit  
- `n` → the number of units in length

---

In **Semio**, you can attach geometry to a Type in different ways 🔄  
You can pick the method that best fits your **workflow or tool**.  

Let’s take a look at how that works in practice 👇 



<Tabs>

<TabItem label="File-Based Reference (🔁 Recommended)">



In **Semio**, Representations are typically referenced through **external geometry files** 🗂️  
— even when those files are generated inside **Grasshopper**

This approach keeps your workflow **clean**, **modular**, and **easy to update** 🧼  
It also makes your design system more **reusable** and **scalable** 🔁

While the modeling process itself isn’t the focus of this tutorial,  
here’s the key takeaway:  
You’ll need to follow **three simple steps** to attach your geometry as a **Representation** 🧱

---

#### 🛠️ Geometry Modeling

Since our shape follows a clear logic 🧠  
we use a **parametric Grasshopper definition** to generate the geometry of the brick mold 🧱  

This is useful because it lets us generate **all the different Variants** of this brick seen in the sketch  
using a single logic controlled by the parameters `n` and `W`  
which define the brick’s length and width 📏

![📁 Geometry Generation](/attach-geometry-crop.gif)

---

#### 💾 Geometry Export

After generating the geometry,  
we need to **export it as a `.glb` file** so it can be attached as a **Representation** 💾

We’ll use a **simple workflow** that automates this export 🦾  
You can place it **directly after** your geometry generation step in Grasshopper 🦗

---

🔁 The Export Workflow Looks Like This:

![📤 Export Geometry](/export-geometry.png)

---

##### 🗂️ Set the Export Location  
Use the `Dir` and `Path` components to define the directory path  
This determines where the exported file will be saved

##### 📝 Build the File Name  
Use `Concat` to generate the file name dynamically  
Combine the Type name and Variant (e.g. `profile` + `2`) → `profile_2.glb`

##### 🧩 Assemble the Full File Path  
Another `Concat` merges directory + file name:  
`C:\Users\Users\Downloads\profile_2.glb`

##### 📐 Prepare the Geometry

> 🛠️ You've already modeled the geometry earlier in your Grasshopper definition.  
> Now it's time to **export** it — so Semio can use it as a **referenced Representation** 💾

- ✅ Convert the geometry into the required format (e.g. **Mesh** for `.glb`)
- 📤 Pass it into the `iGeo` component to export it as a `.glb` file  


Your file directory should now look like this:

![📤 Exported file](/file-export-Profile-2-.png)

---

:::note
⚙️ This method combines the **parametric power of Grasshopper** with the **modular logic of Semio**  
📤 Every time a parameter changes, the file can be **re-exported automatically** —  
ready to be referenced in the next step  
:::


---

#### 🔗 Referencing the Exported File

The exported file (e.g. `profile_2.glb`) is linked to the **`Ur` input** of the **Model Representation** component (`~Rep`)  
This tells Semio **where to find the geometry** that represents your Type.

- 🧩 The **`~Rep` (Model Representation)** component takes the `Ur` file path and creates a Representation:  
  → `Rep(model/gltf-binary)`

- 🔗 This Representation is later connected to the **`Typ` (Model Type)** component —  
  so that your Type is linked to its visual form

![📁 Reference Geometry](/reference-geometry.png)

---

### 🔁 Why Use File-Based Referencing?

Even inside Grasshopper, Semio requires a **file-based snapshot** of your geometry —  
a static file that captures what your brick mold looks like at a specific moment.

Here’s why that matters:

- ⚙️ If your geometry is dynamic or parametric, it still needs to be **exported to a file**  
- 🔗 Semio connects to that file — not the live Grasshopper preview

> 💡 This keeps geometry **modular**, **portable**, and easy to reuse  
> 🧱 It also supports **chunking** — breaking down large designs into smaller, manageable parts  
> 🌐 And it allows smooth transition between **Grasshopper** and **Semio Sketchpad**

<TabItem label="Direct Reference">



You don’t always need to embed geometry directly into a Type 🧱
In some cases, you can skip integration and reference the geometry directly in Grasshopper instead 🎛️

Just pass the geometry — either as a Geometry 🧊 or Object 🧩 — straight into the Preview Design component 👀
This lets you visualize your Design using custom shapes without embedding them into the Type’s definition 🔍

👉 We’ll explore this option in a later step.
⚠️ Just note: this method is for visualization only — the geometry won’t be part of the mold itself

</Tabs>


---

#### 🧪 Switching the Representation 

As introduced earlier, when you give a **Type** its shape in Semio, you're attaching a **Representation** —  
a piece of geometry that shows what the brick looks like visually 👁️

But this geometry isn’t fixed — it acts more like a **placeholder** 🧠  
That means you can **change or swap** the Representation at any time **without breaking your design logic** 🔁

You can think of it like a **costume** for your Type 🎭  
The name, role, and connections stay the same — you're just changing how it looks on stage 🎬

This flexibility is especially useful when working across **different levels of detail** in a project 🧩

Just like architects might use **blocky volumes** for urban massing 🏙️  
and **detailed profiles** for close-ups or fabrication 🪟  
Semio lets you swap the **look** without changing the **logic** 🔄  
Same brick — different shell 💡

##### 🎬 One Brick, various Representations

To illustrate this concept, we created **two geometry files** for the **same brick mold Type**:

---

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="🔍 Detailed Version">

This version uses the **fully detailed geometry** of the piece 🪵  
A rectangle cut at an angle and extruded into a realistic wooden profile ✏️  
It includes every visible detail in 3D: full depth, edges, and joinery-ready shapes 🔍  

![📁 Switch Representation](/Switch-Representation.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-detailed.png)

Best for:
- 🪚 Joinery and production planning  
- 📐 Material-specific outputs  
- 🖼️ Detailed documentation and renders  

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="📄 Sheet Version">

This version is a **flat sheet simplification** 📄  
A single-surface geometry that represents the general size of the piece 📐  
It captures only **one dimension** and skips all 3D detail 🚫

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-sheet.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Use this when:
- 📐 Only the 2D footprint is known  
- ✏️ The full shape is not finalized yet  
- ⚡ You need fast previews or early-stage coordination  

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="📦 Block Version">

This version is a **bounding box simplification** 📦  
A simple block that approximates the piece’s volume ➕  
It includes **two dimensions** but omits exact geometry 🧊 

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-Block.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Best for:
- 🧪 Early-stage layouts and feasibility checks  
- ⚙️ Quick iterations and high-speed previews  
- 🧊 Placeholder geometry before final detailing  

</TabItem>

</Tabs>




---

Even though these two Representations **look very different**  
They both belong to the **same Type** ✅  

The **Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **logic** stay exactly the same  
Only the appearance changes 🎭  

This means you can **design and assemble** everything using lightweight placeholders 🧩  
Then **swap in the detailed version** when you're ready for presentation, communication, or fabrication 🧰  

This separation of **logic and form** is what makes Semio workflows flexible, scalable, and robust 🔄  
From early concept to detailed design to collaborative development 🤝

### ⚓ Add Snapping Points ([Ports](/think-in-semio/#port) - Po)

Once your brick mold has a visual shape — its **Representation** —  
the next step is to define **how it connects to other bricks**  

That’s what **Ports** are for 🧲  
They act as snap points that tell Semio where and how a brick can attach to others  


---

##### 🧩 What Do You Need to Define a Port?

In the Semio Grasshopper plugin, each Port is defined with three main inputs:

- 🏷️ **Port ID** ( `Id` )  
  A unique name for the Port — like a tag or label used to connect it later  
  Examples: `"n"`, `"bottom"`, `"hingePoint"`  

- 📍 **Point** ( `Pt` )  
  The exact spot where the connection happens — like placing a stud on a LEGO brick 🧱  
  You place this carefully on your geometry, right where the snapping should occur  

- ➡️ **Vector** ( `Dr` )  
  The direction the Port faces — telling Semio which way the brick will connect 🔁  
  It’s what lets Semio rotate and align the bricks correctly when snapping them together  


![📁 Ports](/model-port-alpha.png)

---



#### 📍 Port Location (`Pt`)

When modeling Ports, it’s not just about **where** pieces touch —  
it’s about building a **clear and reusable logic** that works across all Variants 🧠🔁

---

Here’s how to define your Ports effectively:

- 🧱 **Choose stable, meaningful locations**  
  Choose positions that are geometrically logical — like the **center of a face**, an **edge midpoint**, or a **corner** 🧩  
  Avoid placing them randomly — symmetry and regular patterns help your logic stay clean ♻️

- 📐 **Keep positions consistent across Variants**  
  Even if your bricks differ in size or shape, place Ports in the **same relative location** 🔄  
  This way, your connection rules stay valid across all versions of a Type 🧰

- 🎯 **Don’t worry about perfect alignment**  
  Ports don’t need to be *exactly* placed.  
  Semio lets you adjust each Piece’s **position and rotation** *after* snapping 🛠️  
  So prioritize clear logic over micrometer precision 😌


---

There’s no strict rule for how many Ports to add — it depends on how much flexibility your system requires:

- 🔒 **Fewer Ports** → simpler, more controlled snapping  
- 🔓 **More Ports** → more layout options and greater orientation flexibility 
- 🧠 **Plan ahead** → add Ports you might need later, even if they’re not used right away


👉 *In our example, we place four Ports — one at the center of each edge of a four-sided profile* 🧱


---

#### 💡 Port Direction (Dr)

Every Port needs a **direction** — a vector that tells Semio which way the connection should face 🧭  
This is how Semio knows how to align and snap your Pieces together correctly 🧲

Here’s how to define Port directions clearly:


- 📏 **Use clean, simple vectors**  
  Stick to basic axes like **X, Y, or Z**  relative to the face the Port sits on. It makes snapping easier and logic more readable 🧠  
  Avoid random or diagonal directions unless needed

- ♻️ **Be consistent across Variants**  
  Ports don’t need to be perfectly precise — but they **must stay consistent**  
  This ensures all your bricks connect correctly no matter the shape or version 🔧

👉 *In our example, each Port faces straight out — perpendicular to the edge it’s placed on* 🚀


---
#### 🏷️ Port ID (Id)

A **Port ID** is the name you give to each Port 🏷️  
This name is how Semio knows **which Port to connect** when snapping Pieces together

For example, you might say:  
> "Connect the `top` Port of Piece A to the `bottom` Port of Piece B"

You can use **any naming system** — as long as it’s clear and consistent:

- Common examples: `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` — for north, south, east, and west 🧭  
- Custom names: `top`, `bottom`, `hinge`, `plug`, `windowDock`, etc. 🧲

💡 **Tip:** Pick a naming system that’s easy to understand and stick to it  
It helps you stay organized and makes teamwork or AI assistance much easier 🤝

---

Together with the **Pt** (position) and **Dr** (direction), the **Id** completes each Port definition:  
Each row in the three lists defines one Port — so all lists must be the **same length** to stay in sync 🧩



---

Now you can see how the three inputs — Id, Pt, and Dr — work together to create Ports.
Each Port is defined by one entry from each list, so the lists must be the same length.
This ensures that every snapping point has a matching ID, position, and direction



  


</li>

### 🧱 Assemble the Mold (Model [Type](/think-in-semio/#type))

Once you’ve defined all parts of your brick mold   
the **Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **Representation**   
you can assemble them using the `Model Type` component (`Typ`) 🧰

Here's what you plug in:

- 🏷️ **Name** — the shared identity of the mold (e.g. `"Profile"`)
- 🔢 **Variant** — the specific version number (e.g. `"2"`)
- 🧲 **Ports** — the snapping points and directions (e.g. `n`, `s`, `e`, `w`)
- 🧊 **Representation** — the geometry that defines the brick's shape

  
![📁 Model Type](/model-type.png)  
![📁 Model Type](/model-type-geo.png)

---

🎯 The result is a complete **Type**   
A reusable brick mold that carries both shape and connection logic

For example, `Typ("Profile", 2)`  
creates Variant `2` of the `"Profile"` mold   
a 2-unit-long brick ready to be placed in your Design 🧱




---

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>


## 🧬 Create Mold Versions (Variants of [Type](/think-in-semio/#type))

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-variant.png)

Now that you've created your base **Type**, it's time to generate **Variants** — based on the **unit count `n`** shown in the sketch 🔢

Each Variant is built from the **same mold**, just stretched or scaled to a different length 📏  
Think of it like longer or shorter LEGO bricks of the same kind 🧱  
Since they follow the same logic and structure, we treat them as **Variants** of one **Type** — not separate Types ♻️

Examples from our sketch:

- `Variant 2` → 2 units long 🟩🟩  
- `Variant 4` → 4 units long 🟩🟩🟩🟩  
- `Variant 5` → 5 units long 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩  


---

#### 🔁 Modeling a Variant


---

##### ✅ What Stays the Same

- 🏷️ **Type name** — you’re still using the same underlying mold

##### 🔄 What Changes?

- 🔢 **Variant name** — a unique label like `2`, `4`, or `5` to distinguish the version  
- 🧊 **Representation** — new geometry that reflects the Variant’s shape or size  
- 🧲 **Ports** — same logic, but positioned relative to the new shape  

---


##### 🛠️ Modeling Steps

1. 🏷️ Set the **Type name** (same as the original mold)  
2. 🔢 Assign a new **Variant name**  
3. 🧊 Attach the **Representation** — the geometry for this Variant  
4. 🧲 Add the **Ports** — positioned consistently  
5. 🧱 Use the `Model Type` component to combine everything into a complete Variant

---

:::note
Keep Port positions consistent across all Variants — it ensures easier snapping and logic reuse
:::

✅ That’s it — same mold, new shape, fully ready for modular design

---



##### 💡 Advanced Tip: Use Clusters to Generate Variants

In Grasshopper, a great way to handle multiple Variants is with a **Cluster**  

Since most Variants share the same logic and differ by only one or two parameters, a Cluster helps you:

- 🔁 Model the logic **once**
- ⚡ Generate all Variants **efficiently**
- 🧼 Keep your script **clean and modular**

![📁 Variant GIF](/Type-1-to-5-crop.gif)

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="📂 File-Based Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**  

You define the full logic:

- 🧊 Generate and export geometry  
- 📎 Link the exported file via `Model Representation`  
- 🧲 Place Ports using `Model Port`  
- 🧱 Create the Variant using `Model Type`

![📁 Cluster](/cluster-type-inside-ALpha.png)

**Outside the Cluster:**  

You only feed in the changing inputs:

- 📏 `n` → the unit count (e.g. 2, 4, 5)  
- 🏷️ Variant name → often also `n`  
- 📁 Directory of the GH file  
- 🔘 Export toggle

<TabItem label="🧱 Direct Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**  

You define the full modeling logic directly, without saving external files:

- 🧊 Generate geometry  
- 🧲 Place Ports using `Model Port`
