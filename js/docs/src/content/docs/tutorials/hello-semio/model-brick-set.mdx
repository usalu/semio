As mentioned earlier in **[Thinking in Semio](/think-in-semio/)**,  
A **Type** is your brick mold 🧱 The Blueprint behind each Brick  
It defines not just the shape, but also the design meaning and connection logic 🔧


---

##### 🧩 What Are the "Molds" in This Example?

Take a look at your sketch 👀  
You'll see five elements that follow the **same basic shape**, just stretched to different lengths 📏

Even though the final Design includes five Pieces, they're made from only **three distinct shapes**  
with two of them used twice — giving us **three Variants of one Type** 🔢

🧱 Think of it like a LEGO brick that comes in 2-stud, 4-stud, and 5-stud versions —  
same shape logic, just scaled 📐

If the shape were completely different — like a triangle, window, or roof ⛰️🪟🏠  
That would count as a **new Type** altogether

---

##### 🧠 Modeling with Meaning


When you think of a mold, the first thing that comes to mind is usually its **shape** — the geometry 🧱✏️  
But in Semio, the **mold** is what combines **shape** with **meaningful design information** 💡

In traditional Grasshopper workflows, you’re modeling with **raw data** — points, curves, and surfaces — without embedding **design intent** 🧬  
You build logic around it, but that logic stays detached — abstract, custom, and often fragile.

> In **Semio**, the mold connects geometry with design intent directly 🧠  
> You're not referencing arbitrary geometry — you're referencing **relationships**, **roles**, and **rules** 🧩

For example:  
👉 Instead of saying "connect point (x, y, z) to Brep edge 23"  
👉 You say "connect the **door** to the **living room**" 🛋️🚪  
👉 Or in LEGO terms: "🪟 **snap the window brick onto the top of the wall**" 🧱

This is what gives Semio its strength — you’re not just building shapes,  
you’re building a **semantic system** that adapts, scales, and speaks your design language 🎯🗣️

---

## 🧰 Create a Brick Mold ([Type](/think-in-semio/#type) – Ty)

Let’s begin by modeling the mold shown in the sketch  
This will serve as the base for generating its **Variants** 🧩

![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-mold.png)

Before we start building, let’s go over the essential elements that define a **Type** 🧱:

- 🏷️ **Name** → A unique name to identify your Type and reuse it in different designs  
- 🧱 **Geometry (Representation)** → The 3D shape attached to the Type — it gives the piece its visual form ✨  
- 🧲 **Connection Points (Ports)** → The snap points where the piece connects to others in the system 🔗

Now let’s take a closer look at how these elements come together — and start modeling our first **brick mold** 🛠️



<Steps>
<ol>

<li>

### 🏷️ Name Your Mold ([Type](/think-in-semio/#type) Name - Na)

Clear, consistent names in Semio make everything easier down the line ✅  
Especially when your project grows and you're working with many **Types**, **Variants**, and **Pieces** 🔄

Good names help you:

- 🧭 **Navigate** your system  
- 🔍 **Understand** relationships  
- 🔗 **Make connections** that are easy to track

:::note
Use names you'd use in a real project — specific, descriptive, and purposeful 📝 
:::

👉 In our example, we’ll name our Type **"Profile"**  
because the shape we're modeling is based on a **standard manufactured wood profile** 🪵


---

</li>

<li>

### 🧊 Attach Geometry (Representation – Rp)

In Semio, the process of adding geometry to a Type is called **modeling its Representation** 🛠️
A **Representation** is anything that visually or symbolically **represents a Type** 🧱
It helps you **see or recognize** the Type — without defining its logic or behavior 🧠

In most cases, this will be a **3D geometry**, like in our example
But it can also be:

- A 2D drawing or diagram ✏️  
- A symbolic icon or block 🔳  
- A label, file, or reference 🔖

💡 Because Representations are separate from the logic of the system, they’re fully flexible:

- You can start modeling your system without one 🚧  
- You can add or update it later 🛠️  
- You can switch between levels of detail depending on the design phase 🔍

In this example, we’ll use a **simple 3D shape** to represent our brick molds we need to create 🧩


---

##### 🔧 Modeling Representation

There are two simple steps to create a Representation:


- 🛠️ **Step 1 — Build the geometry**  
  Create the actual shape of your brick — the form you want to use in your design

- 📎 **Step 2 — Attach it to the Type**  
  This links the shape to your Type, making it visible and placeable in the design space

---

Let’s take a closer look at the **brick mold** in our example 👀  
It always follows the **same basic shape** 🧱  
A **rectangle that’s cut at an angle** ✂️ — just repeated in different lengths 📏  

As we saw in the sketch, its size is described using **two parameters**:

- `W` → the width of one brick unit  
- `n` → the number of units in length

---

In **Semio**, you can attach geometry to a Type in different ways 🔄  
You can pick the method that best fits your **workflow or tool**.  

Let’s take a look at how that works in practice 👇 



<Tabs>

<TabItem label="File-Based Reference (🔁 Recommended)">



In **Semio**, Representations are typically referenced through **external geometry files** 🗂️  
— even when those files are generated inside **Grasshopper**

This approach keeps your workflow **clean**, **modular**, and **easy to update** 🧼  
It also makes your design system more **reusable** and **scalable** 🔁

While the modeling process itself isn’t the focus of this tutorial,  
here’s the key takeaway:  
You’ll need to follow **three simple steps** to attach your geometry as a **Representation** 🧱

---

#### 🛠️ Geometry Modeling

Since our shape follows a clear logic 🧠  
we use a **parametric Grasshopper definition** to generate the geometry of the brick mold 🧱  

This is useful because it lets us generate **all the different Variants** of this brick seen in the sketch  
using a single logic controlled by the parameters `n` and `W`  
which define the brick’s length and width 📏

![📁 Geometry Generation](/attach-geometry-crop.gif)

---

#### 💾 Geometry Export

After generating the geometry,  
we need to **export it as a `.glb` file** so it can be attached as a **Representation** 💾

We’ll use a **simple workflow** that automates this export 🦾  
You can place it **directly after** your geometry generation step in Grasshopper 🦗

---

🔁 The Export Workflow Looks Like This:

![📤 Export Geometry](/export-geometry.png)

---

#### 🗂️ Set the Export Location  
Use the `Dir` and `Path` components to define the directory path  
This determines where the exported file will be saved

#### 📝 Build the File Name  
Use `Concat` to generate the file name dynamically  
Combine the Type name and Variant (e.g. `profile` + `2`) → `profile_2.glb`

#### 🧩 Assemble the Full File Path  
Another `Concat` merges directory + file name:  
`C:\Users\Users\Downloads\profile_2.glb`

#### 📐 Prepare the Geometry

> 🛠️ You've already modeled the geometry earlier in your Grasshopper definition.  
> Now it's time to **export** it — so Semio can use it as a **referenced Representation** 💾

- ✅ Convert the geometry into the required format (e.g. **Mesh** for `.glb`)
- 📤 Pass it into the `iGeo` component to export it as a `.glb` file  


Your file directory should now look like this:

![📤 Exported file](/file-export-Profile-2-.png)

---

:::note
⚙️ This method combines the **parametric power of Grasshopper** with the **modular logic of Semio**  
📤 Every time a parameter changes, the file can be **re-exported automatically** —  
ready to be referenced in the next step  
:::


---

#### 🔗 Referencing the Exported File

The exported file (e.g. `profile_2.glb`) is linked to the **`Ur` input** of the **Model Representation** component (`~Rep`)  
This tells Semio **where to find the geometry** that represents your Type.

- 🧩 The **`~Rep` (Model Representation)** component takes the `Ur` file path and creates a Representation:  
  → `Rep(model/gltf-binary)`

- 🔗 This Representation is later connected to the **`Typ` (Model Type)** component —  
  so that your Type is linked to its visual form

![📁 Reference Geometry](/reference-geometry.png)

---

### 🔁 Why Use File-Based Referencing?

Even inside Grasshopper, Semio requires a **file-based snapshot** of your geometry —  
a static file that captures what your brick mold looks like at a specific moment.

Here’s why that matters:

- ⚙️ If your geometry is dynamic or parametric, it still needs to be **exported to a file**  
- 🔗 Semio connects to that file — not the live Grasshopper preview

> 💡 This keeps geometry **modular**, **portable**, and easy to reuse  
> 🧱 It also supports **chunking** — breaking down large designs into smaller, manageable parts  
> 🌐 And it allows smooth transition between **Grasshopper** and **Semio Sketchpad**





</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Direct Reference">



You don’t always need to embed geometry directly into a Type 🧱
In some cases, you can skip integration and reference the geometry directly in Grasshopper instead 🎛️

Just pass the geometry — either as a Geometry 🧊 or Object 🧩 — straight into the Preview Design component 👀
This lets you visualize your Design using custom shapes without embedding them into the Type’s definition 🔍

👉 We’ll explore this option in a later step.
⚠️ Just note: this method is for visualization only — the geometry won’t be part of the mold itself

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


---

#### 🧪 Switching the Representation 

As introduced earlier, when you give a **Type** its shape in Semio, you're attaching a **Representation** —  
a piece of geometry that shows what the brick looks like visually 👁️

But this geometry isn’t fixed — it acts more like a **placeholder** 🧠  
That means you can **change or swap** the Representation at any time **without breaking your design logic** 🔁

You can think of it like a **costume** for your Type 🎭  
The name, role, and connections stay the same — you're just changing how it looks on stage 🎬

This flexibility is especially useful when working across **different levels of detail** in a project 🧩

Just like architects might use **blocky volumes** for urban massing 🏙️  
and **detailed profiles** for close-ups or fabrication 🪟  
Semio lets you swap the **look** without changing the **logic** 🔄  
Same brick — different shell 💡

##### 🎬 One Brick, various Representations

To illustrate this concept, we created **two geometry files** for the **same brick mold Type**:

---

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="🔍 Detailed Version">

This version uses the **fully detailed geometry** of the piece   
a rectangle cut at an angle and extruded into a realistic wooden profile 🪵  
It includes every visible detail in 3D: full depth, edges, and joinery-ready shapes ✂️

![📁 Switch Representation](/Switch-Representation.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-detailed.png)

Best for:
- 🪚 Joinery and production planning  
- 📐 Material-specific outputs  
- 🖼️ Detailed documentation and renders  

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="📄 Sheet Version">

This version is a **flat sheet simplification**  
a single-surface geometry that represents the general size of the piece 📏  
It captures only **one dimension** and skips all 3D detail

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-sheet.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Use this when:
- 📐 Only the 2D footprint is known  
- ✏️ The full shape is not finalized yet  
- ⚡ You need fast previews or early-stage coordination  

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="📦 Block Version">

This version is a **bounding box simplification**   
a simple block that approximates the piece’s volume 🧱  
It includes **two dimensions** but omits exact geometry

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-Block.png)  
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Best for:
- 🧪 Early-stage layouts and feasibility checks  
- ⚙️ Quick iterations and high-speed previews  
- 🧊 Placeholder geometry before final detailing  

</TabItem>

</Tabs>




---

Even though these two Representations **look very different**, they both belong to the **same Type** ✅. The **Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **logic** stay exactly the same — only the appearance changes

This means you can **design and assemble** everything using lightweight placeholders,  
then **swap in the detailed version** when you're ready for presentation, communication, or fabrication 🧰

This separation of **logic and form** is what makes Semio workflows flexible, scalable, and robust, from early concept to detailed design to collaborative development 🤝

### ⚓ Add Snapping Points ([Ports](/think-in-semio/#port) - Po)

Once you've modeled the visual look of your brick mold (Representation), it's time to decide **where** these bricks connect to each other  
That's where **Ports** come in — the snap points that define where a Brick can attach 🧲

---

##### 🧩 What Do You Need to Define a Port?

In the Semio Grasshopper plugin, each Port is defined with three main inputs:

- **A Port ID** 🏷️ (Id)  
  The name of the Port — a label used to define connections, such as `"n"`, `"bottom"`, or `"hingePoint"`

- **A Point** 📍 (Pt)  
  The exact location where the connection happens — like the stud or socket on a LEGO brick.  
  You place it carefully on the surface of your geometry

- **A Vector** ➡️ (Dr)  
  The direction the Port faces — like saying “this side connects outward”  
  It’s important for aligning pieces when snapping


![📁 Ports](/model-port-alpha.png)

---



#### 💡 Port Location (Pt)

(Add Image of the sketch with the ports)

When modeling Ports, it’s not just about where pieces touch — it’s about creating a clear, logical system that works across all Variants.

Here’s how to define your Ports effectively:

- 📍 **Choose stable, meaningful locations**  
  Place Ports in central or geometrically stable spots — like the center of a face, edge, corner, or endpoint.  
  Avoid placing them randomly across a surface. Symmetry often helps make your logic more reusable

- ♻️ **Keep positions consistent across Variants**  
  Even if your pieces vary in length or size, try to place Ports in the same relative positions  
  This keeps your connection logic intact across all Versions of a Type

- 🎯 **Don’t worry about perfect alignment**  
  Semio allows you to adjust a Piece’s position and rotation *after* it snaps — so focus on logical placement, not exact fits.

---

There’s no strict rule for how many Ports to add — it depends on how much flexibility your system requires:

- 🔒 **Fewer Ports** → simpler, more controlled snapping  
- 🔓 **More Ports** → greater layout or orientation flexibility  
- 🧠 **Plan ahead** → add Ports you might need later, even if they’re not used right away


👉 *In our example, we use four Ports placed at the center of each edge of a four-sided profile

---

#### 💡 Port Direction (Dr)


Every Port needs a direction — a vector that tells Semio which way the connection faces  
This is essential for aligning pieces correctly when snapping them together

Here’s how to define direction effectively:

- ➡️ **Think of it as the “facing” of the Port**  
  The direction vector shows which way the Port is meant to connect — like saying, “this side points outward”

- 🧭 **Use simple, readable vectors**  
  Stick to clean, orthogonal directions when possible (e.g. X, Y, or Z axes).  
  This keeps alignment predictable and easier to debug.

- ♻️ **Prioritize consistency over precision**  
  The pieces can still be moved or rotated after snapping, so vectors don’t have to be exact  
  but they **must be consistent** across all Variants to keep your logic reliable

👉 *In our example, all edge Ports face outward — perpendicular to the face they sit on*


---
#### 🏷️ Port ID (Id)

A **Port ID** is the label you give to each Port  
This naming is important — because later, when you make connections, you'll say things like:

> "Connect Piece A's `top` Port to Piece B's `bottom` Port"

You can choose any naming system — as long as it makes sense in your design logic  
In this example, we use:

- `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` — standing for **north, south, east, and west** 🧭

In your own project, you might use:

- `top`, `bottom`, `hinge`, `plug`, `outlet`, `windowDock` — or anything else 🔧

💡 **Tip:** Choose a consistent and meaningful naming system.  
It will make connecting components easier — and helps when working with AI or teammates.

---

Now you can see how the three inputs — Id, Pt, and Dr — work together to create Ports.
Each Port is defined by one entry from each list, so the lists must be the same length.
This ensures that every snapping point has a matching ID, position, and direction

### 🧱 Assemble the Mold (Model [Type](/think-in-semio/#type))

After modeling all the parts of your brick mold —  
**Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **Representation** —  
you plug them into the `Typ` component.

- 🏷️ **Name** → e.g. `"Profile"`  
- 🔢 **Variant** → e.g. `"2"`  
- 🧲 **Ports** → e.g. `n`, `s`, `e`, `w`  
- 🧊 **Representation** → the linked geometry

  {/* TODO: insert Image of Type component with the inputs */}
![📁 Model Type](/model-type.png)

![📁 Model Type](/model-type-geo.png)


  🎯 The result is a complete Type —
  a smart, reusable mold, ready to be casted into your Design
  🧩 The output `Typ("profile", 2)` means we're creating a Variant **named `2`** based on the `"profile"` mold 🧱 — a 2-unit-long brick 📏



---

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>



## 🧬 Create Mold Versions (Variants of [Type](/think-in-semio/#type))


![📤 sketch drawing](/sketch-drawing-variant.png)


Now that you've created your base **Type**, it's time to generate **Variants** — based on the **unit count `n`** shown in the sketch

Each Variant uses the **same mold**, just stretched or scaled.  
 Think of it like longer or shorter Lego bricks of the same kind 🧱
 Since they follow the same design logic, we treat them as **Variants** of one **Type**, not separate Types.

- **Variant 2** → 2 units long

- **Variant 4** → 4 units long

- **Variant 5** → 5 units long

---

#### 🔁 Modeling a Variant

Modeling a **Variant** follows the **same steps** as creating a new Type —  
but with one key difference: you're referencing the **same mold**, just with a new configuration

Here’s what changes:

1. **Reuse** the original **Type name** 🏷️  
2. **Assign** a new **Variant name** (e.g. `n`, the unit count) 🔢

You’ll still go through the usual modeling steps:

1. Name your mold (**Type Name**)  
2. Attach geometry (**Model Representation**)  
3. Add Ports (**Model Port**)  
4. Set the Variant number  
5. Create the complete **Model Type**

:::note
🧭 Keeping Port positions **consistent across Variants** makes your Types easier to reuse, align, and assemble smoothly
:::

✅ Just like when modeling a Type, you define the Representation, Ports, and final Model Type — only the **Variant** changes

---



##### 💡 Advanced Tip: Use Clusters to Generate Variants

In Grasshopper, a great way to handle multiple Variants is with a **Cluster** —  
a reusable mold-maker that generates each version of your LEGO brick 🧱

Since most Variants share the same logic and differ by only one or two parameters, a Cluster helps you:

- Model the logic once  
- Generate all Variants efficiently  
- Keep your script clean and modular


![📁 Variant GIF](/Type-1-to-5-crop.gif)

<Tabs>

<TabItem label=" File-Based Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**  

You define the full logic:

- Geometry generation & export   
- Modeling the Representation by linking the exported file  (Model Representation)
- Port placement (Model Port)
- Type creation (Model Type)

![📁 Cluster](/cluster-type-inside-ALpha.png)


**Outside the Cluster:**  

![📁 Cluster](/type-cluster-file-reference-Alpha.png)

![📁 Cluster](/file-export.png)

You feed in only what changes:

- `n` → the unit count (e.g. 2, 4, 5) 📏  
- Variant name → (often also `n`) 🏷️
- The Directory of the Grasshopper Definition
- Export toggle
 


</TabItem>

<TabItem label=" Direct Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**

This way, you can generate many Variants from the same Type —  
without duplicating components or cluttering your canvas

✅ **Bonus:** Keeps your file organized and scalable — perfect for growing your Kit later on
