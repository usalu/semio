As mentioned earlier in **[Thinking in Semio](/think-in-semio/)**, a **Type** is like a **brick mold**.  

You're not just drawing geometry — you're designing a **template** that combines shape with meaningful design information.

---

##### 🧩 What Are the "Molds" in This Example?

Take a look at your sketch — you'll see five elements that follow the **same basic shape**, just stretched to different lengths.

Even though the final Design includes five Pieces, they're made from only **three distinct shapes**,  
with two of them used twice — giving us **three Variants of one Type**.

🧱 Think of it like a LEGO brick that comes in 2-stud, 4-stud, and 5-stud versions — same shape logic, just scaled.

If the shape were completely different — like a triangle, window, or roof — that would count as a **new Type** altogether.


---

##### 🔧 What Do We Need to Create These Molds?

When you think of a mold, the first thing that comes to mind is usually its **shape** — the geometry 🧱✏️  
But in Semio, geometry is more than form — it serves as a **placeholder for meaning** 💡

In traditional Grasshopper workflows, geometry is just raw data 🧬  
But in Semio, it becomes part of your **design language** 🗣️🎨 — a way to represent **intent**, not just surfaces 🎯

For example:  
👉 Instead of saying "connect point (x, y, z) to Brep edge 23"  
👉 You say "connect the **door** to the **living room**"  
👉 Or in LEGO terms: "**snap the window brick onto the top of the wall**" 🪟🧱

🔗 The geometry still exists — but now it stands in for something more: **a role, a relationship, a meaning**.


---

## 🧰 Create a Brick Mold (Type - Ty)

Let’s begin by modeling the mold shown in the sketch. 
This will serve as the base for generating its Variants.

Before we start building it, let’s go over the essential elements that define a Type:

- **🏷️ Name** → A unique name to identify your Type and reuse it in different designs.  
- **🧱 Geometry (Representation)** → The 3D shape attached to the Type. It gives the piece its visual form.  
- **🧲 Connection Points (Ports)** → The snap points where the piece connects to others in the system.

Let’s take a look at the elements that make up a Type, and dive into modeling our first brick mold.

<Steps>
<ol>

<li>

### 🏷️ Name Your Mold (Type Name - Na)

Giving clear and consistent names to elements in Semio **really pays off later** — especially when designing and making connections.  
As your project grows and you're working with many Types, Variants, and Pieces, meaningful names make everything easier to navigate and understand.

:::note
📝 Try to name things the way you would in a real project — clear, specific, and with purpose
:::


👉 In our example, we’ll name our Type **'Profile'**, since we’re modeling Pieces based on custom wood shapes with a defined profile


---

</li>

### 🧊 Attach Geometry (Representation – Rp)


In Semio, when you give a Type its shape, you're adding a **Representation** 🧱  
This isn’t just visual geometry — it’s a **layer of meaning** that stands in for a design element.

Think of it like snapping a shell onto a LEGO mold — now your brick has a visible form 👀  
But that form isn’t fixed. A Representation is more like a **costume** — it can be swapped at any time, as long as it fits the logic.

Just like architects might use a blocky volumes for urban models 🏙️ or detailed profiles for close-ups 🪟,  
Semio lets you change the **look** without changing the **design logic** 🔄  
Same brick, different shell — that’s the idea 💡

---

##### 🔧 Modeling Representation

Creating a Representation works in two simple steps:  
🧱 First, you build the geometry — the actual shape of your brick  
📎 Then, you attach that shape to your Type to give it a visual form

Let’s take a closer look at the brick mold in our example.  
You’ll notice that it’s always the same shape 🧱 a rectangle cut at an angle ✂️ just stretched into different sizes 📏

We’ll use these two parameters to define its size:

- `W` → the width of one brick unit  
- `n` → the number of units in length

🧰 Next, we’ll dive into how to create and attach geometry to your brick mold.  
🧱 In Semio, you can attach geometry to a Type in different ways — depending on what fits your workflow best.  
👀 Let’s take a look at how that works in practice


<Tabs>

<TabItem label="File-Based Reference (🔁 Recommended)">



In Semio, Representations are typically referenced through **external geometry files** 🗂️ — even when generated inside Grasshopper.  
This approach helps maintain **clean, modular workflows** 🧼 and supports flexible updates.

While the modeling process itself isn’t the focus of this tutorial, the key takeaway is this:
you’ll need to go through two simple steps to attach this geometry as a Representation


---

#### Step 1: 🛠️ Geometry modeling 

Since our shape follows a clear logic 🧠, we use a **parametric Grasshopper definition** to generate the geometry of the brick mold 🧱  
This is useful because it lets us generate **all the different Variants** of this brick seen in the sketch, using a single logic controlled by the parameters `n` and `W`, which define the brick’s length and width 📏


![📁 Geometry Generation](/attach-geometry-crop.gif)


#### Step 2: 🛠️ Geometry Export

After generating the geometry, we need to **export it as a `.glb` file** so it can be attached as a Representation.  
💾 We’ll use a simple workflow that automates this export — it can be placed directly after your geometry definition in Grasshopper.

The modeling of the geometry happens earlier in the Grasshopper definition 🛠️  
here, we’ll focus mainly on the **export logic**: how to turn that geometry into a file Semio can reference. 💾

**The export workflow looks like this:**




{/* TODO: insert export geometry image */}

![📤 Export Geometry](/export-geometry.png)




- 📂 **Set the Export Location**  
  A directory path is defined using the `Dir` and `Path` components.  
  This determines where the exported file will be saved.

- 📝 **Build the File Name**  
  The file name is generated dynamically using `Concat`,  
  combining the Type name (e.g. `profile`) and the Variant (e.g. `2`) → `profile_2.glb`

- 📂 **Assemble the Full File Path**  
  A second `Concat` block merges the directory and file name:  
  `C:\Users\Users\Downloads\profile_2.glb`

- 📐 **Prepare the Geometry**  
  - Convert or prepare the geometry in the desired format (e.g. Mesh)  
  - The `iGeo` component then writes the `.glb` file to disk

  Your file directory, where your Grasshopper definition is, should look like this:

  ![📤 Exported file](/file-export-Profile-2-.png)

 :::note
⚙️ This method is ideal because it combines the familiar **parametric workflow** of Grasshopper with the **modular workflow** of Semio.  
📤 Every time a parameter is changed in the geometry generation, the corresponding file can be **automatically exported** and then **referenced** in the next step.
:::



---

#### Step 3: 🔗 Referencing the Exported File

The exported file name (e.g. `profile_2.glb`) is passed to the **`Ur` input** of the **Model Representation** component (`~Rep`).  
This tells Semio where to find the geometry file.

- The **`~Rep` (Model Representation)** component uses the `Ur` path — the file location — to create a Representation:  
  `Rep(model/gltf-binary)`

- This Representation is then connected in a later step to the **`Typ` (Model Type)** component.

{/* TODO: insert Referencing the Exported File image */}

---

##### 🔁 Why Use File-Based Referencing?

Even when working inside Grasshopper, Semio needs a **static snapshot** of your geometry —  
a file that captures the shape of your brick mold at that moment.

Here’s what that means:

- If your geometry is generated dynamically, it still needs to be **exported as a file**  
- Semio references that exported file — not the live Grasshopper definition

> 💡 This approach keeps your geometry **modular and portable**, so it works seamlessly across Grasshopper and Semio Sketchpad  
> 🧱 It also enables working in **chunks** — letting you break large designs into smaller, manageable parts

#### 🧪 Switching the Representation (Placeholder principle)


As introduced earlier, when you give a **Type** its shape in Semio, you're attaching a **Representation** —  
a piece of geometry that shows what the brick looks like visually 👁️.  
But this geometry is more than just form: it acts as a **semantic placeholder** 🧠.  
That means you can **change or swap** the Representation at any time **without breaking your design logic** 🔁

You can think of it like a **costume** for your Type 🎭  
The identity, name, and behavior stay the same — you're just changing how it looks on stage.

This flexibility is especially useful when working at **different levels of detail** across a project 🧩

##### 🎬 One Brick, various Representations

To illustrate this concept, we created **two geometry files** for the **same brick mold Type**:

---

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="🔍 Detailed Version">


This version uses the **fully detailed geometry** of the piece —  
a rectangle cut at an angle and extruded into a realistic wooden profile 🪵
It includes every visible detail in 3D: full depth, edges, and joinery-ready shapes

![📁 Switch Representation](/Switch-Representation.png)
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-detailed.png)


It reflects **real-world shape and fabrication detail**, making it ideal for:
- Joinery and production planning  
- Material-specific outputs  
- Detailed documentation and renders


{/* TODO: insert Detailed Version image */}

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="⚡ Sheet Version">
This version is a **flat sheet simplification** —  
a single-surface geometry that represents the general size of the piece 📄.  
It captures only **one dimension** , and skips all 3D detail.

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-sheet.png)
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Use this when:
- Only the 2D footprint is known  
- The full shape is not finalized yet  
- You need fast previews or early-stage coordination

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="⚡ Block Version">

This version is a **bounding box simplification** —  
a simple block that approximates the piece’s volume 📦.  
It includes **two dimensions** , but omits exact geometry.

![📁 Switch Representation](/switch-representation-Block.png)
![📁 Filename](/Profile-2-simplified.png)

Best for:
- Early-stage layouts and feasibility checks  
- Quick iterations and high-speed previews  
- Placeholder geometry before final detailing

{/* TODO: insert Simplified Version image */}
</TabItem>

</Tabs>




---

Even though these two Representations **look very different**, they both belong to the **same Type** ✅. The **Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **logic** stay exactly the same — only the appearance changes.

This means you can **design and assemble** everything using lightweight placeholders,  
then **swap in the detailed version** when you're ready for presentation, communication, or fabrication 🧰.

> 💡 In Semio, the Representation doesn’t define the part — it simply **stands in for it**.  
> Like a LEGO minifig in different outfits 🧑‍🚀🕵️ — it's still the same character underneath.

This separation of **logic and form** is what makes Semio workflows flexible, scalable, and robust, from early concept to detailed design to collaborative development 🤝

### ⚓ Add Snapping Points (Ports - Po)

Once you've modeled the visual look of your brick mold (Representation), it's time to decide **where** these bricks connect to each other.  
That's where **Ports** come in — the snap points that define where a Brick can attach 🧲

---

##### 🧩 What Do You Need to Define a Port?

In the Semio Grasshopper plugin, each Port is defined with three main inputs:

- **A Port ID** 🏷️ (Id)  
  The name of the Port — a label used to define connections, such as `"n"`, `"bottom"`, or `"hingePoint"`.

- **A Point** 📍 (Pt)  
  The exact location where the connection happens — like the stud or socket on a LEGO brick.  
  You place it carefully on the surface of your geometry.

- **A Vector** ➡️ (Dr)  
  The direction the Port faces — like saying “this side connects outward.”  
  It’s important for aligning pieces when snapping.


![📁 Ports](/model-port-alpha.png)
---



#### 💡 Port Location (Pt)

(Add Image of the sketch with the ports)

When modeling Ports, it’s not just about where pieces touch — it’s about creating a clear, logical system that works across all Variants.

Here’s how to define your Ports effectively:

- 📍 **Choose stable, meaningful locations**  
  Place Ports in central or geometrically stable spots — like the center of a face, edge, corner, or endpoint.  
  Avoid placing them randomly across a surface. Symmetry often helps make your logic more reusable.

- ♻️ **Keep positions consistent across Variants**  
  Even if your pieces vary in length or size, try to place Ports in the same relative positions.  
  This keeps your connection logic intact across all Versions of a Type.

- 🎯 **Don’t worry about perfect alignment**  
  Semio allows you to adjust a Piece’s position and rotation *after* it snaps — so focus on logical placement, not exact fits.

---

There’s no strict rule for how many Ports to add — it depends on how much flexibility your system requires:

- 🔒 **Fewer Ports** → simpler, more controlled snapping  
- 🔓 **More Ports** → greater layout or orientation flexibility  
- 🧠 **Plan ahead** → add Ports you might need later, even if they’re not used right away

👉 *In our example, we use four Ports placed at the center of each edge of a four-sided profile

---

#### 💡 Port Direction (Dr)


Every Port needs a direction — a vector that tells Semio which way the connection faces.  
This is essential for aligning pieces correctly when snapping them together.

Here’s how to define direction effectively:

- ➡️ **Think of it as the “facing” of the Port**  
  The direction vector shows which way the Port is meant to connect — like saying, “this side points outward.”

- 🧭 **Use simple, readable vectors**  
  Stick to clean, orthogonal directions when possible (e.g. X, Y, or Z axes).  
  This keeps alignment predictable and easier to debug.

- ♻️ **Prioritize consistency over precision**  
  The pieces can still be moved or rotated after snapping, so vectors don’t have to be exact  
  but they **must be consistent** across all Variants to keep your logic reliable.

👉 *In our example, all edge Ports face outward — perpendicular to the face they sit on.*


---
#### 🏷️ Port ID (Id)

A **Port ID** is the label you give to each Port.  
This naming is important — because later, when you make connections, you'll say things like:

> "Connect Piece A's `top` Port to Piece B's `bottom` Port."

You can choose any naming system — as long as it makes sense in your design logic.  
In this example, we use:

- `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` — standing for **north, south, east, and west** 🧭

In your own project, you might use:

- `top`, `bottom`, `hinge`, `plug`, `outlet`, `windowDock` — or anything else 🔧

💡 **Tip:** Choose a consistent and meaningful naming system.  
It will make connecting components easier — and helps when working with AI or teammates.

---

Now you can see how the three inputs — Id, Pt, and Dr — work together to create Ports.
Each Port is defined by one entry from each list, so the lists must be the same length.
This ensures that every snapping point has a matching ID, position, and direction

### 🧱 Assemble the Mold (Model Type)

After modeling all the parts of your brick mold —  
**Name**, **Variant**, **Ports**, and **Representation** —  
you plug them into the `Typ` component.

- 🏷️ **Name** → e.g. `"Profile"`  
- 🔢 **Variant** → e.g. `"2"`  
- 🧲 **Ports** → e.g. `n`, `s`, `e`, `w`  
- 🧊 **Representation** → the linked geometry

  {/* TODO: insert Image of Type component with the inputs */}
![📁 Model Type](/model-type.png)

![📁 Model Type](/model-type-geo.png)


  🎯 The result is a complete Type —
  a smart, reusable mold, ready to be casted into your Design.
  🧩 The output `Typ("profile", 2)` means we're creating a Variant **named `2`** based on the `"profile"` mold 🧱 — a 2-unit-long brick 📏



---

</li>

</ol>
</Steps>



## 🧬 Create Mold Versions (Variants of Type)

Now that you've created your base **Type**, it's time to generate **Variants** — based on the **unit count `n`** shown in the sketch.

Each Variant uses the **same mold**, just stretched or scaled.  
 Think of it like longer or shorter Lego bricks of the same kind 🧱
 Since they follow the same design logic, we treat them as **Variants** of one **Type**, not separate Types.

- **Variant 2** → 2 units long

- **Variant 4** → 4 units long

- **Variant 5** → 5 units long

---

#### 🔁 Modeling a Variant

Modeling a **Variant** follows the **same steps** as creating a new Type —  
but with one key difference: you're referencing the **same mold**, just with a new configuration.

Here’s what changes:

1. **Reuse** the original **Type name** 🏷️  
2. **Assign** a new **Variant name** (e.g. `n`, the unit count) 🔢

You’ll still go through the usual modeling steps:

1. Name your mold (**Type Name**)  
2. Attach geometry (**Model Representation**)  
3. Add Ports (**Model Port**)  
4. Set the Variant number  
5. Create the complete **Model Type**


✅ Just like when modeling a Type, you define the Representation, Ports, and final Model Type — only the **Variant** changes.

##### 💡 Advanced Tip: Use Clusters to Generate Variants

In Grasshopper, a great way to handle multiple Variants is with a **Cluster** —  
a reusable mold-maker that generates each version of your LEGO brick 🧱

Since most Variants share the same logic and differ by only one or two parameters, a Cluster helps you:

- Model the logic once  
- Generate all Variants efficiently  
- Keep your script clean and modular


![📁 Variant GIF](/Type-1-to-5-crop.gif)

<Tabs>

<TabItem label=" File-Based Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**  

You define the full logic:

- Geometry generation & export   
- Modeling the Representation by linking the exported file  (Model Representation)
- Port placement (Model Port)
- Type creation (Model Type)

![📁 Cluster](/cluster-type-inside-ALpha.png)


**Outside the Cluster:**  

![📁 Cluster](/type-cluster-file-reference-Alpha.png)

![📁 Cluster](/file-export.png)

You feed in only what changes:

- `n` → the unit count (e.g. 2, 4, 5) 📏  
- Variant name → (often also `n`) 🏷️
- The Directory of the Grasshopper Definition
- Export toggle
 


</TabItem>

<TabItem label=" Direct Geometry Reference">

**Inside the Cluster:**

This way, you can generate many Variants from the same Type —  
without duplicating components or cluttering your canvas.

✅ **Bonus:** Keeps your file organized and scalable — perfect for growing your Kit later on
