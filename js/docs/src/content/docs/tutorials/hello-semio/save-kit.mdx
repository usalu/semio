Once you’ve created your custom bricks (Types), built your structure (Design), and everything fits together nicely — it’s time to pack it all up into a *Kit*! 🎁 
Think of this as boxing up your LEGO set so you (or others) can build it again later.

-

# 🎯 Why Save a Kit?

Saving a Kit allows you to:

- *Reuse* it across different projects 🧰
- *Share* it with your team or students 🤝
- *Test* and version it as your system evolves 🧪
- *Import* it into semio Studio or back into Grasshopper anytime 🌐

This makes your modular logic *portable*, *editable*, and *collaborative*.

# 🧩 What’s Inside the Kit?

A Kit in semio is a complete bundle — not just geometry, but structure, meaning, and logic. 
Here’s what’s inside:

- *Types* – the molds for your bricks 🧱
 Each Type includes: 
 - *Representation* (geometry) 🧊
 - *Ports* (snap points) 🧲
 - ️ *Metadata* (semantic info) 🏷

- *Pieces* – the actual bricks used in your Design 🧩
 These are the placed instances of your Types, each with its own ID (e.g., `Red-T`, `Blu-B`, `Yel`).

- *Connections* – all the snapping instructions 🔗
 This includes every single connection between all Pieces: 
 - Which Port connects to which 
 - Any transformations (shift, rotate, tilt, etc.)

Together, these elements define a fully functional modular system — ready to assemble, remix, or expand in any future design. 🧱🛠️

# 🛠️ Build Your Kit in Grasshopper

To assemble your Kit in Grasshopper, plug your modular setup into the `~Kit` component.

# You'll need to connect:

- ️ *Name* – the name of your Kit (e.g. `"hello semio"`) 🏷
- *Description* – a short summary (e.g. `"The most simple semio kit."`) 📝
- *Types* – all your defined `Typ(.)` bricks 🧱
- *Designs* – any `Dsn(.)` layouts you want to include 🧩

When connected correctly, you’ll see an output like: 
`Kit(hello semio)` — your boxed-up building system, ready to go! 🧩📦

📁 A Kit is simply a folder that holds all your semio data — Types, geometry, and design logic — bundled into one reusable package.
