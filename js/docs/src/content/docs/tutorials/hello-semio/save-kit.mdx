Once you’ve created your custom bricks (Types), built your structure (Design), and everything fits together nicely — it’s time to pack it all up into a _Kit_! 🎁
Think of this as boxing up your LEGO set so you (or others) can build it again later

---

## 🎯 Why Save a Kit?

Saving a Kit allows you to:

- _Reuse_ it across different projects 🧰
- _Share_ it with your team or students 🤝
- _Test_ and version it as your system evolves 🧪
- _Import_ it into semio Studio or back into Grasshopper anytime 🌐

This makes your modular logic _portable_, _editable_, and _collaborative_

## 🧩 What’s Inside the Kit?

A Kit in semio is a complete bundle — not just geometry, but structure, meaning, and logic
Here’s what’s inside:

- _Types_ – the molds for your bricks 🧱
  Each Type includes:
  - _Representation_ (geometry) 🧊
  - _Ports_ (snap points) 🧲
  - ️ _Metadata_ (semantic info) 🏷

- _Pieces_ – the actual bricks used in your Design 🧩
  These are the placed instances of your Types, each with its own ID (e.g., `Red-T`, `Blu-B`, `Yel`)

- _Connections_ – all the snapping instructions 🔗
  This includes every single connection between all Pieces:
  - Which Port connects to which
  - Any transformations (shift, rotate, tilt, etc.)

Together, these elements define a fully functional modular system — ready to assemble, remix, or expand in any future design 🧱🛠️

## 🛠️ Build Your Kit in Grasshopper

To assemble your Kit in Grasshopper, plug your modular setup into the `~Kit` component

### You'll need to connect:

- ️ _Name_ – the name of your Kit (e.g `"hello semio"`) 🏷
- _Description_ – a short summary (e.g `"The most simple semio kit."`) 📝
- _Types_ – all your defined `Typ(...)` bricks 🧱
- _Designs_ – any `Dsn(...)` layouts you want to include 🧩

When connected correctly, you’ll see an output like:
`Kit(hello semio)` — your boxed-up building system, ready to go! 🧩📦

📁 A Kit is simply a folder that holds all your semio data — Types, geometry, and design logic — bundled into one reusable package
