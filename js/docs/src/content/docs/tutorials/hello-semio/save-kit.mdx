Once you’ve created your custom bricks (Types), built your structure (Design), and everything fits together nicely — it’s time to pack it all up into a **Kit**! 🎁  
Think of this as boxing up your LEGO set so you (or others) can build it again later.

---

## 🎯 Why Save a Kit?

Saving a Kit allows you to:

- 🧰 **Reuse** it across different projects  
- 🤝 **Share** it with your team or students  
- 🧪 **Test** and version it as your system evolves  
- 🌐 **Import** it into Semio Studio or back into Grasshopper anytime

This makes your modular logic **portable**, **editable**, and **collaborative**.

## 🧩 What’s Inside the Kit?

A Kit in Semio is a complete bundle — not just geometry, but structure, meaning, and logic.  
Here’s what’s inside:

- 🧱 **Types** – the molds for your bricks  
  Each Type includes:  
  - 🧊 **Representation** (geometry)  
  - 🧲 **Ports** (snap points)  
  - 🏷️ **Metadata** (semantic info)

- 🧩 **Pieces** – the actual bricks used in your Design  
  These are the placed instances of your Types, each with its own ID (e.g., `Red-T`, `Blu-B`, `Yel`).

- 🔗 **Connections** – all the snapping instructions  
  This includes every single connection between all Pieces:  
  - Which Port connects to which  
  - Any transformations (shift, rotate, tilt, etc.)

Together, these elements define a fully functional modular system — ready to assemble, remix, or expand in any future design. 🧱🛠️

## 🛠️ Build Your Kit in Grasshopper

To assemble your Kit in Grasshopper, plug your modular setup into the `~Kit` component.

### You'll need to connect:

- 🏷️ **Name** – the name of your Kit (e.g. `"hello semio"`)  
- 📝 **Description** – a short summary (e.g. `"The most simple semio kit."`)  
- 🧱 **Types** – all your defined `Typ(...)` bricks  
- 🧩 **Designs** – any `Dsn(...)` layouts you want to include

When connected correctly, you’ll see an output like:  
`Kit(hello semio)` — your boxed-up building system, ready to go! 🧩📦

📁 A Kit is simply a folder that holds all your Semio data — Types, geometry, and design logic — bundled into one reusable package.
