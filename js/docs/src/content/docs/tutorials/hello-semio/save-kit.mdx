This page explains how to save your semio setup as a reusable Kit.

## ðŸ“¦ Save As a Kit
â†’ Export and reuse your setup as a modular design system

Once you have defined your **Types** (brick molds with their geometry, Ports, and Variants) and perhaps even assembled an example **Design**, you'll likely want to save this entire setup for later use or for sharing with others. In semio, this is typically referred to as saving or exporting your **Kit**.

A **Kit** in semio encapsulates all the definitions of your modular components:
- **Types**: The fundamental templates for your bricks.
- **Variants**: Different versions of your Types (e.g., different sizes, materials).
- **Representations**: The geometry associated with each Type/Variant.
- **Ports**: The connection points defined on your Types.
- **Metadata**: Any additional semantic information you've included.

By saving this as a Kit, you create a self-contained package that represents your modular design system. This Kit can then be:
- **Reused** in new projects.
- **Shared** with team members.
- **Versioned** and updated over time.
- **Imported** into different semio environments (e.g., from Grasshopper to semio Studio or vice-versa).

The specific steps to save or export a Kit will depend on the semio tools you are using (e.g., Grasshopper plugin, semio Studio). Generally, this involves a command or component that serializes your Type definitions and related information into a file or a format that semio can understand.

This allows you to build libraries of modular components, making your design process more efficient, scalable, and collaborative.
