{/* ELO - Expected Learning Outcomes */}
{/* - Explain reusability based on graphs not geometry */}
{/* - Explain top-down recursive placeholder-based design based on types */}
{/* - Explain bottom-up and simulating assembly processes */}
{/* - semio allows top-down and bottom-up. Grasshopper is bottom up because lack of abstraction (placeholder). */}

import { Steps, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. [Download the `geometry` example kit]() ⬇️

   After unpacking the `geometry.zip` you should see:

   <FileTree>

   - .semio/
   - pentagon.gh
   - hexagon.gh
   - designs
     - dome.gh
   - types
     - block.gh
   - representations
     - block-orange.glb
     - block-black.glb
     - block-yellow.glb
     - block-white.glb
     - …
   - …

   </FileTree>

2. Open the `hello-semio.gh` file 📂
