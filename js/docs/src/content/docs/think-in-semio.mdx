## 🧩 Understanding Semio: The Anatomy of a Modular Design System

Let’s say you’ve just bought a big Lego box. Inside, you can build a spaceship, a castle, or a race car. Everything starts from that box—and that’s how Semio’s architecture works too.

---

## 📦 1. Kit = The LEGO Box
<br />
A **Kit** is the full Lego set you own 🧰  
It holds all the parts, instructions, and models you need to build anything 🧱  
In Semio, the Kit is your **project container** 📁  
It includes everything related to your modular system:  
📁 **Designs**, 🧱 **Building Blocks**, 🔗 **Connection Logic**, and 📊 **Various Data** 📦

:::note[Organize Everything]
Kits allow you to organize an entire system in one place 🧩  
Their elements are **reusable** across projects or teams 🔄
:::

---

## 🧾 2. Design = The Model You Build
<br />
A **Design** is one specific thing you build  
like a 🚀 **spaceship**, 🧱 **launchpad**, or 🏰 **tower** 🛠️  
It's made of multiple Lego pieces arranged with intention 🎯  
You can build many different Designs from the same Kit 🧰  
In Semio, a Design is a 📸 **snapshot**  
a specific arrangement of **Pieces** and how they connect 🔗

:::note[One Kit, Many Designs]
A single Kit can include **multiple Designs**, each showing a different configuration 📚
:::

## 🧱 3. Type = The Unique Brick Mold
<br />

A **Type** is a distinct kind of Lego brick 🧊  
such as a 2×4 block, a window, or a roof tile 🧱  
It’s the **blueprint** of a component: what it is, how it looks, and how it connects 🔧  
Once defined, a Type can be reused as many times as needed 🧩  
This helps you build consistent, modular systems

:::note[Variants vs. New Types]
A **2×4 red brick** 🟥 and a **3×2 grey brick** ⬜ are variants of the same Type. They follow the same design logic 📏  
A **window** 🪟 serves a different function and logic, so it becomes a separate Type 🧠
:::

---

## 🔁 4. Piece = A Brick You Actually Use
<br />
A **Piece** is an individual brick placed in your design 🧩  
It’s an **instance** of a Type that appears in a Design 🧱  
If you use ten red 2×4 bricks, each one is a separate Piece  
but from the same mold 🧰  
Each Piece inherits: 🧬 **Geometry**, 🧠 **Semantics**, 📄 **Metadata** 🔗

:::note[Placed and Inherited]
Pieces are the **building blocks** of your design 🛠️  
They bring Types to life by placing them into real configurations 🧩
:::

---

## ⚓ 5. Port = The Connection Point
<br />
A **Port** is a smart connector  
like a stud or socket 🧱  
It's defined **only where needed** and shows where a Piece can attach 🧲  
Each Port is defined on the Type and inherited by all its Pieces 🧩  
It tells the system **where** and **how** to connect 🔧

:::note[Just One Port]
Unlike classic Lego with many studs 🔳, Semio uses **just the Ports that matter** 🎯  
To stack two Pieces, define one Port on the **top** ⬆️ and one on the **bottom** ⬇️. Simple and precise
:::

---

## 🔗 6. Connection = The Snapping Together
<br />
A **Connection** defines how two bricks come together 🧷  
Like snapping a window onto a wall 🪟  
It's not a shape. It's a **rule** that aligns Ports and joins components 🧠

📐 **Example:**  
> "Connect the top Port of Piece A ⬆️ to the bottom Port of Piece B ⬇️"

:::note[Logic, Not Geometry]
Connections define **assembly logic** 🔄  
They let you keep your design **structured**, **modular**, and easy to reconfigure 🧠
