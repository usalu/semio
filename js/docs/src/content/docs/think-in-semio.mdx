description: 📖 An introduction to kit-of-parts architecture and how semio relates to it 🔀

## 📦 1. Kit = The LEGO Box
<br />
A Kit is the full Lego set you own 🧰  
It holds all the parts, instructions, and models you need to build anything 🧱  
In Semio, the Kit is your project container 📁  
It includes everything related to your modular system:  
📁 Designs, 🧱 Building Blocks, 🔗 Connection Logic, and 📊 Various Data 📦

:::note[Organize Everything]
Kits allow you to organize an entire system in one place 🧩  
Its elements are reusable across projects or teams 🔄
:::

## 🧾 2. Design = The Model You Build
<br />
A Design is one specific thing you build  
like a 🚀 spaceship, 🧱 launchpad, or 🏰 tower 🛠️  
It's made of multiple Lego pieces arranged with intention 🎯  
You can build many different Designs from the same Kit 🧰  
In Semio, a Design is a 📸 snapshot  
a specific arrangement of Pieces and how they connect 🔗

:::note[Multiple Designs per Kit]
A Kit could include multiple Designs 📚

## 🧱 3. Type = The Unique Brick Mold
<br />
A Type is a distinct kind of Lego brick 🧊  
such as a 2×4 block, a window, or a roof tile 🧱  
You can think of a Type as the definition or blueprint of a building component 📐  
It describes what it is, what it looks like, and how it connects 🔧  
Once defined, a Type can be reused as many times as needed  
helping you build consistent and modular systems 🧩

:::note[Variants and Separation]
A Type can have different variants 🧬  
For example, a 2×4 red brick 🟥 and a 3×2 grey brick ⬜ are both variants of the same Type because they follow the same design logic 📏  
On the other hand, a window 🪟 serves a different purpose and follows different rules, so it is considered a separate Type 🧠

## 🔁 4. Piece = A Brick You Actually Use
<br />
A Piece is an individual brick placed in your design 🧩  
It’s a specific instance of a Type that appears within a Design 🧱  
If you use ten red 2×4 bricks, each one is a separate Piece  
but they all come from the same mold 🧰  
Each Piece inherits everything from its Type:  
🧬 Geometry, 🧠 Semantics, 📄 Various Metadata 🔗

:::note[From Type to Reality]
Pieces are the building blocks of your design 🛠️  
They bring Types to life by placing them into real configurations 🧩
:::

---

## ⚓ 5. Port = The Connection Point
<br />
A Port is a smart, intentional connector 🧲  
Think of it like a Lego stud or socket 🧱 but placed exactly where it's needed 🎯  
Each Port acts as a docking spot, telling the system where and how a Piece should attach to another 🔧  
Ports are defined once on a Type and automatically inherited by all its Pieces 🧩

:::note[Precision Over Quantity]
Unlike classic Lego bricks with many studs on every surface 🔳, Semio uses only the Ports that matter 🎯  
To stack two Pieces, for example, you just define one Port on the top ⬆️ and one on the bottom ⬇️
:::

---

## 🔗 6. Connection = The Snapping Together
<br />
A Connection defines how two bricks come together 🧷  
Like snapping a window piece onto a wall 🪟  
It's not a shape or object. It's a rule 🧠  
It tells the system which Ports should connect and how they align ⚓

📐 **Example:**  
“Connect the top Port of Piece A ⬆️ to the bottom Port of Piece B ⬇️” 🧩

:::note[Design as Logic]
Connections describe assembly logic 🔄  
They allow your design to be structured, modular, and flexible without relying on fixed geometry 🧠
