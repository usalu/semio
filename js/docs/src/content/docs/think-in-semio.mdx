##### 🧩 Understanding semio: The Anatomy of a Modular Design System

Let’s say you’ve just bought a big LEGO box. Inside, you can build a spaceship, a castle, or a race car. Everything starts from that box, and that’s how semio’s architecture works too.

## <span id="kit">📦 Kit = The LEGO Box</span>

<br />

- A **Kit** is your complete LEGO set 🧰
- It holds all the parts, instructions, and models you need to build anything 🧱
- In semio, the Kit is your **project container** 📁
- It includes everything related to your modular system:
  - 📁 Designs, 🧱 Building Blocks, 🔗 Connection Logic, 📊 Various Data

<br />

:::note  
**Kits** keep your whole system in one place 🧩  
You can reuse Kit elements across multiple projects or teams 🔄

## <span id="design">🧾 Design = The Model You Build</span>

<br />

- A **Design** is one specific thing you build
  - Like a spaceship 🚀, a launchpad 🧱, or a tower 🏰
- It’s made of multiple LEGO parts arranged with intention 🎯
- You can build many different Designs from the same building components 🧰

<br />

:::note  
A Kit can include multiple Designs 📚

## <span id="type">🧱 Type = The Unique Brick Mold</span>

<br />

A **Type** in semio is your **brick mold** — the unique template behind a **distinct kind of brick** 🧱

- 🧊 Each Type defines a **distinct** brick mold
  - That means: a unique combination of shape, role, and connection logic
  - For example: a 2×4 brick, a window brick, or a roof brick 🧱
- 📐 It acts as the **blueprint** of that brick
  - Describing **what it is**, **how it looks**, and **how it connects** 🔧
- ♻️ Once defined, a Type can be **reused** to create many identical bricks
  - Helping you build **modular**, **consistent**, and **scalable** systems 🧩

<br />

:::note[💡 A Common Mistake to Avoid]  
It’s easy to think that a 2×4 red brick 🟥 and a 3×2 gray brick ⬜ should be different Types.  
But in semio, they can be **variants of the same Type** if they follow the same **design logic**.

✅ Differences in size, color, or detail are just variations, as long as the overall structure and the way these connect feel like part of the same family.

🧱 Create a new Type only when the **design language changes**.  
For example, a window 🪟 introduces a different rhythm, visual structure, and connection pattern. It doesn’t feel like the same kind of block anymore, so it should be its own Type.

## <span id="piece">🔁 Piece = A Brick You Actually Use</span>

<br />

- A **Piece** is an individual brick you place in your design 🧱
  - It’s a **distinct instance** of a Type — the brick mold it was made from 🧰
- For example, if you use ten red 2×4 bricks, each one is a separate Piece — but they all come from the same mold
- Each Piece inherits the following from its Type:  
  🧬 **Geometry** – its shape  
  🧠 **Design meaning** – what it represents  
  🔌 **Connection Points** – where and how it snaps to others  
  📄 **Metadata** – additional properties

<br />

:::note  
Pieces are the actual **building blocks** in your design 🛠️  
They turn your abstract molds into real configurations you can assemble and manipulate 🧩

## <span id="port">⚓ Port = The Connection Point</span>

<br />

- A **Port** is a smart, intentional connector 🧲
  - Like a LEGO stud or socket 🧱, but placed exactly where it’s needed 🎯
- Each Port tells the system where and how a Piece connects 🔧
- Ports are defined once on a **Type** and automatically inherited by all its **Pieces** 🧩

<br />

:::note[Minimal Ports, Maximum Clarity]  
LEGO bricks have studs on every side 🔳, but in semio, you only add Ports where they’re needed.  
To connect two pieces, one Port on top ⬆️ and one on the bottom ⬇️ is enough.

You can place Ports all over if you want, or just in specific spots to guide the design.  
:::

---

## <span id="connection">🔗 Connection = The Snapping Together</span>

<br />

- A **Connection** defines how two bricks fit together 🧷
  - Like snapping a window piece onto a wall 🪟
- It’s not a shape or object — it’s a **rule** 🧠
- It tells the system which Ports to join and how they align ⚓

📐 **Example:**  
“Connect the top Port of Piece A ⬆️ to the bottom Port of Piece B ⬇️”

<br />

:::note  
Connections define how your design is assembled 🔄  
They don’t rely on fixed geometry. Instead, they let you build flexible, modular systems where parts can be rearranged, replaced, or repeated without breaking the structure 🧠
