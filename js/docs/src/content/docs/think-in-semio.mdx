##### 🧩 Understanding semio: The Anatomy of a Modular Design System  
Let’s say you’ve just bought a big LEGO box. Inside, you can build a spaceship, a castle, or a race car. Everything starts from that box, and that’s how Semio’s architecture works too.

## <span id="kit">📦 Kit = The LEGO Box</span>
<br />

- A **Kit** is your complete LEGO set 🧰  
- It holds all the parts, instructions, and models you need to build anything 🧱  
- In Semio, the Kit is your **project container** 📁  
- It includes everything related to your modular system:  
  - 📁 Designs, 🧱 Building Blocks, 🔗 Connection Logic, 📊 Various Data  

<br />

:::note  
**Kits** keep your whole system in one place 🧩  
You can reuse Kit elements across multiple projects or teams 🔄

## <span id="design">🧾 Design = The Model You Build</span>
<br />

- A **Design** is one specific thing you build  
  - Like a spaceship 🚀, a launchpad 🧱, or a tower 🏰  
- It’s made of multiple LEGO parts arranged with intention 🎯  
- You can build many different Designs from the same building components 🧰  

<br />

:::note  
A Kit can include multiple Designs 📚

## <span id="type">🧱 Type = The Unique Brick Mold</span>
<br />

- A **Type** is a mold for creating a distinct kind of LEGO brick 🧊  
  - Such as a 2×4 block, a window, or a roof tile 🧱  
- A Type is the **definition** or **blueprint** of a building component 📐  
  - It describes what it is, what it looks like, and how it connects 🔧  
- Once defined, a Type can be reused as many times as needed  
  - It helps you build consistent and modular systems 🧩  

<br />

:::note[💡 A Common Mistake to Avoid]  
It’s easy to think that a 2×4 red brick 🟥 and a 3×2 grey brick ⬜ should be different Types.  
But in Semio, they can be **variants of the same Type** if they follow the same **design logic**.

✅ Differences in size, color, or detail are just variations, as long as the overall structure and the way pieces connect feel like part of the same family.

🧱 Create a new Type only when the **design language changes**.  
For example, a window 🪟 introduces a different rhythm, visual structure, and connection pattern. It doesn’t feel like the same kind of block anymore, so it should be its own Type.

## <span id="piece">🔁 Piece = A Brick You Actually Use</span>
<br />

- A **Piece** is an individual brick placed in your design 🧩  
  - It’s a specific **instance of a Type** (the mold) that appears within a Design 🧱  
- If you use ten red 2×4 bricks, each one is a separate Piece, but they all come from the same mold 🧰  
- Each Piece inherits information from its Type: 🧬 Geometry, 🧠 Semantics, 📄 Metadata 🔗  

<br />

:::note  
Pieces are the geometrical building blocks of your design 🛠️  
They bring Types to life by placing them into real configurations 🧩  
:::

## <span id="port">⚓ Port = The Connection Point</span>
<br />

- A **Port** is a smart, intentional connector 🧲  
  - Like a LEGO stud or socket 🧱, but placed exactly where it’s needed 🎯  
- Each Port tells the system where and how a Piece connects 🔧  
- Ports are defined once on a **Type** and automatically inherited by all its **Pieces** 🧩  

<br />

:::note[Minimal Ports, Maximum Clarity]  
LEGO bricks have studs on every side 🔳, but in Semio, you only add Ports where they’re needed.  
To connect two pieces, one Port on top ⬆️ and one on the bottom ⬇️ is enough.  

You can place Ports all over if you want, or just in specific spots to guide the design.  
:::

---

## <span id="connection">🔗 Connection = The Snapping Together</span>
<br />

- A **Connection** defines how two bricks fit together 🧷  
  - Like snapping a window piece onto a wall 🪟  
- It’s not a shape or object — it’s a **rule** 🧠  
- It tells the system which Ports to join and how they align ⚓  

📐 **Example:**  
“Connect the top Port of Piece A ⬆️ to the bottom Port of Piece B ⬇️”

<br />

:::note  
Connections define how your design is assembled 🔄  
They don’t rely on fixed geometry. Instead, they let you build flexible, modular systems where parts can be rearranged, replaced, or repeated without breaking the structure 🧠
