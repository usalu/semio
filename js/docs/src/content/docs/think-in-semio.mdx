## 🧩 Understanding semio: The Anatomy of a Modular Design System
Let’s say you’ve just bought a big Lego box. Inside, you can build a spaceship, a castle, or a race car. Everything starts from that box 
, and that’s how Semio’s architecture works too.

### 📦 1. Kit = The LEGO Box
<br />
- A Kit is the **full Lego set** you own 🧰  
-  It holds all the parts, instructions, and models you need to build anything 🧱  
- In semio, the Kit is your project container 📁  
    - It includes everything related to your modular system:  
        - 📁 Designs,
        - 🧱 Building Blocks
        - 🔗 Connection Logic 
        - 📊 Various Data 📦

:::note
Kits allow you to organize an entire system in one place 🧩  
Its elements are reusable across projects or teams 🔄
:::

### 🧾 2. Design = The Model You Build
<br />
- A Design is one specific thing you build  
    - like a 🚀 spaceship, 🧱 launchpad, or a 🏰 tower   
- It's made of multiple Lego parts arranged with intention 🎯  
- You can build many different Designs from the same building components 🧰  


:::note
A Kit could include multiple Designs 📚

### 🧱 3. Type = The Unique Brick Mold
<br />
- A Type is a mold  for creating **distinct** kind of Lego bricks 🧊  
    - such as a 2×4 block, a window, or a roof tile 🧱  
- You can think of a Type as the **definition** or **blueprint** of a building component 📐  
    - It describes what it is, what it looks like, and how it connects 🔧  
- Once defined, a Type can be reused as many times as needed  
    - it helps you build consistent and modular systems 🧩

:::note[A Common Mistake to Avoid]
It's easy to assume a 2×4 red brick 🟥 and a 3×2 grey brick ⬜ should be separate Types.  
But in semio, they can be **variants of the same Type** ✅ As long as components follow the same design rules, size and color differences can be handled as **variants**.

💡 **Tip:**  
Create a new Type only when the geometry or behavior is fundamentally different.  
For example, a window 🪟 isn't just a visual variation. it connects and functions differently, so it belongs to a separate Type 🧠

### 🔁 4. Piece = A Brick You Actually Use
<br />
- A Piece is an individual brick placed in your design 🧩  
    - It’s a specific **instance of a Type** (the mold) that appears within a Design 🧱  
- If you use ten red 2×4 bricks, each one is a separate Piece  
    - but they all come from the same mold 🧰  
- Each Piece inherits all the infoemations from its Type:  
    - 🧬 Geometry, 
    - 🧠 Semantics,
    - 📄 Various Metadata 🔗

:::note
Pieces are the geometrical building blocks of your design 🛠️  
They bring Types to life by placing them into real configurations 🧩
:::

### ⚓ 5. Port = The Connection Point
<br />
- A Port is a smart, intentional **connector** 🧲  
    - Think of it like a Lego stud or socket 🧱 but placed exactly where it's needed 🎯  
- Each Port acts as a docking spot, telling the system where and how a Piece should attach to another 🔧  
- Ports are defined once on a Type and automatically inherited by all its Pieces 🧩

:::note[Minimal Ports, Maximum Clarity]
Unlike classic Lego bricks with many studs on every surface 🔳 semio uses only the Ports that matter 🎯 To stack two Lego bricks on top of each other, you just define one Port on the top ⬆️ and one on the bottom ⬇️  
:::

---

### 🔗 6. Connection = The Snapping Together
<br />
- A Connection defines how two bricks **come together** 🧷  
    - Like snapping a window piece onto a wall 🪟  
- It's not a shape or object. It's a rule 🧠  
- It tells the system which Ports should connect and how they align ⚓

📐 **Example:**  
“Connect the top Port of Piece A ⬆️ to the bottom Port of Piece B ⬇️” 🧩

:::note
Connections describe assembly logic 🔄  
They allow your design to be structured, modular, and flexible without relying on fixed geometry 🧠
