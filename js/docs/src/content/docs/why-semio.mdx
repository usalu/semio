title:  💡 Why semio
description: 📖 An introduction to Building-Information-Modeling (BIM) and how semio relates to it 🔀

import { Tabs, TabItem, Card } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Design today is increasingly **system-based**, **modular**, and **dynamic**.  
But most tools are still built around **static components** and **fixed categories**.  
They assume you begin with **geometry**, not with **structure**, **logic**, or **relationships**.  

> **semio takes a different approach.**  
To support a more flexible, system-oriented way of working, we introduced a new modeling foundation:

---

### 🧠 What is Design Information Modeling?

**Design Information Modeling (DIM)** is a modeling approach developed by semio to support a level of architectural thinking that most tools overlook.  

- Model **design logic** instead of static shapes 🧩  
- Use **relationships**, **abstractions**, and **references** to define systems 🔗  
- Focus on **how it is all connected**, not only **how it looks** 🛠️

---

### 🧱 Why We Created DIM

**Building Information Modeling (BIM)** brought a major shift to architectural workflows by introducing **semantics**:  
> Rather than just drawing lines, you place **smart objects** (like walls or windows) with embedded data, enabling efficient documentation and coordination later on.  

However, this comes with constraints:

- Fixed building elements make **non-standard designs** hard to model 🚧  
  - **Inclined walls** 🏔️  
  - **Split-level structures** 🏠  
  - **Free-form roofs** 🌊  

<br />
-  BIM assumes most design decisions are already made.  
- It’s not built for 
  - modular systems, 
  - adaptive relationships, or 
  - custom logic 

  especially in early design.

#### This is how BIM tools read architecture

to **isolated parts** 🧩

> This is the difference between semio and other BIM tools 💡**  
In **semio**, you're not just arranging components! you're designing how they ****, how they ****, and how they can ****.  



## 🤨 When should I use Semio?

Use Semio when:

- You’re designing modular or repeatable systems  
- You want to collaborate across tools and teams  
- You care about reusability and scalability  
- You think in systems, not just shapes  

Semio is not a replacement for your tools — it’s a foundation to build on 🧱
