title:  💡 Why semio
description: 📖 An introduction to Building-Information-Modeling (BIM) and how semio relates to it 🔀

## 🧭 Why Rethink the Way We Model?

Most tools model what things **are** — not how they **work**.

Designers think in **systems**, **rules**, and **intentions** 🎯  
But traditional tools still ask for:

- Fixed categories 🏷️  
- Static shapes 📦  
- Predefined components 🧱  

> 🧠 **Semio flips this script.**  
> It lets you model **relationships**, **systems**, and **design logic** —  
> before locking into fixed geometry.

## 🧰 From Shapes to Systems

### ✏️ Traditional Modeling

Modeling used to mean: **drawing shapes**.

You worked with:

- Lines ✏️  
- Volumes 📐  
- Layers 📊  

> You drew *how something looked* —  
> not how it behaved, connected, or evolved.

It was **visual**, but not **relational**.  
It described **form**, but not **function**.

---

### 🏗️ BIM — Building Information Modeling

Then came **BIM** — a big shift 💥  
It brought **semantics** into the model.  
Walls, windows, roofs: no longer just lines, but **smart objects** with embedded data 📦

That changed a lot.  
But BIM still makes big assumptions:

- You’ve already decided the design 🗂️  
- You’re working toward documentation 📄  
- You’re picking from fixed types 🧱

#### ❌ Limitations of BIM:

- Hard to model **non-standard geometry** 🌀  
- Hard to design **modular systems** 🧩  
- Hard to encode **custom logic** ⚙️  

:::note[What’s hard to model in BIM?]
- Inclined walls 🏔️  
- Split-level structures 🧗  
- Generative layouts or kinetic elements 🔁

### 🧠 DIM — Design Information Modeling

**Design Information Modeling (DIM)** is a modeling approach developed by **Semio** 🔬  
It’s made for the kind of work **architects actually do** in early stages.

Instead of modeling finished **objects** — you model:

- 🧩 **Rules** — What connects or repeats  
- 🔗 **Relationships** — How parts interact  
- 🛠️ **Behaviors** — How systems respond or adapt

> DIM puts **design logic first** — and lets geometry follow.

It’s modular, flexible, and nonlinear —  
Ideal for **early-stage thinking**, **collaborative teams**, and **complex systems**.

---

## 🤔 So why DIM over BIM?

BIM is great for:  
✅ Construction documents  
✅ Industry coordination  
✅ Standardized elements  

But it struggles when you need to:

- Build your own logic 🧠  
- Design a system, not a structure 🧩  
- Evolve ideas without predefined categories 🔀  

That’s where **Semio** and **DIM** come in.

#### This is how BIM tools read architecture

> As a catalog of elements 📚        
> quantified, categorized, and ready for construction  📊  
> but often detached from the logic behind the design 🔍

> This is the difference between semio and other BIM tools 💡**  
In **semio**, you're not just arranging components! you're designing how they ****, how they ****, and how they can ****.  



## 🤨 When should I use Semio?

Use Semio when:

- You’re designing modular or repeatable systems  
- You want to collaborate across tools and teams  
- You care about reusability and scalability  
- You think in systems, not just shapes  

Semio is not a replacement for your tools — it’s a foundation to build on 🧱
