:::note[Are you a Mac user?]
The code of semio is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux but currently compiled for Windows only ⚠️
[Reach out to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/m6nnf6pQRc) if you want to help us extend it for Mac 👐

semio has two user-interfaces:

- Grasshopper 🦗
- sketchpad ✏️

### 🦗 Grasshopper (Rhino 8)

[sketchpad](https://github.com/usalu/semio/releases/download/r24.07-1/sketchpad.exe) is a portable program and needs no installation. To use sketchpad with Grasshopper you need to download semio Grasshopper `2.1.2`. If you want to use sketchpad standalone you need to download, extract and start the [engine](https://github.com/usalu/semio/releases/download/r24.07-1/engine.zip). After this you can open the [examples](https://github.com/usalu/semio/releases/download/r24.07-1/examples.zip)🏎️
