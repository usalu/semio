## 📃 Principles

semio is built on top of the following premises:

- **[🔓 Open over closed](#open-over-closed):** Futureproof technology needs to be developed together 🤝
- **[🖱️ Manual over automated](#manual-over-automated):** Design supported and not derived by technology 🪛
- **[👥 Team over individual](#team-over-individual):** To collaborate efficiently we need interfaces 🧩
- **[♻️ Composable over disposable](#composable-over-disposable):** Even the most complex systems can be thought of parts 🧠
- **[🧪 Implementation over specification](#implementation-over-specification):** Hands-on instead of head-first ✍️
- **[🔀 Integration over generality](#integration-over-generality):** We don't want to replace existing tools but extend them 🚀
- **[🔨 Simple over complex](#simple-over-complex):** Complexity arises on it's own 🌱
- **[📖 Example over theory](#example-over-theory):** To avoid building an ivory tower 🗼
- **[🏛️ Architecture over modeling](#architecture-over-modeling):** We need more architecture-focused toolchains ✏️
- **[🏗️ Prefab over custom](#prefab-over-custom):** For economic and ecologic solutions 📉

### 🔓 Open over closed

semio stands on the shoulder of giants 🏙️ It is built with cutting-edge open-source technology 🌍
| Tool | Users | Followers | Contributors |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| [User Interface](https://github.com/facebook/react) | 27,800,000 | 234,000 | 1,698 |
| [3D Engine](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) | 465,000 | 105,000 | 1,977 |

The reason why computer science is so successful is because all of its core is open-source 🤝

Big IT-companies have realized that an open core is the best way for an industry to grow 📈

The monetization shouldn't happen on the core technology but on the services around them 💰

As customers we pay for:

- Shared collaboration environments
- Productivity enhancing features
- Private working spaces
- Integration with company-specific infrastructure
- …

We don't care about the underlying:

- Libraries
- Engines
- APIs
- CLIs
- SDKs
- …

Software companies of the Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC) industry have made the mistake to compete on the core technology instead of the services around them ❌

They have built closed-source core technology with open-source extensions to lock you into their platform 🔒

That's why semio is built the other way around 🔄️

The core technology is open-source and the extensions are closed-source 🔓

This way the industry can grow together by sharing the effort of building the core technology and companies that offer cloud solutions, ai features, … can still be profitable 📈
