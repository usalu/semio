## 🧩 Understanding Semio: The Anatomy of a Modular Design System

Let’s say you’ve just bought a big Lego box...

### 📦 1. Kit = The LEGO Box

A Kit is the entire Lego set you own...

:::note[Semio Role]
The top-level folder that contains all Designs, Types, Pieces, data, and connection logic.  
Can include: Multiple Designs, reusable components, metadata, and logic rules.
:::

### 🧾 2. Design = The Model You Build

A Design is one specific thing you choose to build...

:::note[Semio Role]
A defined arrangement of components that exists within a Kit.  
Example: One Kit might include spaceship, base, and launchpad Designs.
:::

### 🧱 3. Type = The Unique Brick Mold

A Type is like a specific kind of Lego brick...

:::note[Semio Role]
The reusable template for creating components.  
Example: “2x4 brick” is a Type.
:::

### 🔁 4. Piece = A Brick You Actually Use

...

:::note[Semio Role]
A direct instance of a Type that exists in a Design.  
Note: Every component in a Design is a Piece.
:::

### ⚓ 5. Port = The Connection Point on a Brick

...

:::note[Semio Role]
A defined interface on a Type that allows logical attachment.  
Note: Ports enable modular systems to connect.
:::

### 🔗 6. Connection = The Snapping Together

...

:::note[Semio Role]
The rule that links two Ports in a Design.  
Example: “Top of Piece A → Bottom of Piece B”.
