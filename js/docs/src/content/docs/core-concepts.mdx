# 📃 Core Principles of Semio

Semio is built around 10 key principles that guide how it's developed, used, and extended

- **[🔓 Open over closed](#open-over-closed)** — Futureproof technology is built together, not behind walls 🤝  
- **[🖱️ Manual over automated](#manual-over-automated)** — Technology should support design, not replace it 🪛  
- **[👥 Team over individual](#team-over-individual)** — Collaboration needs interfaces, not silos 🧩  
- **[♻️ Composable over disposable](#composable-over-disposable)** — Complex systems are made of simple parts 🧠  
- **[🧪 Implementation over specification](#implementation-over-specification)** — Learn by building ✍️  
- **[🔀 Integration over generality](#integration-over-generality)** — Extend existing tools instead of replacing them 🚀  
- **[🔨 Simple over complex](#simple-over-complex)** — Start simple, let complexity emerge 🌱  
- **[📖 Example over theory](#example-over-theory)** — Show, don’t tell 🗼  
- **[🏛️ Architecture over modeling](#architecture-over-modeling)** — Focus on structure, not just form ✏️  
- **[🏗️ Prefab over custom](#prefab-over-custom)** — Reuse enables better ecology and economy 📉

### [🔓 Open over closed](#open-over-closed)

Semio is built entirely on open-source foundations because lasting innovation grows in the open 🌍

:::note[Did you know?]  
Semio stands on the shoulders of giants 🏙️ — built using cutting-edge open technologies:
| Tool | Users | Followers | Contributors |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| [React (UI)](https://github.com/facebook/react) | 27,800,000 | 234,000 | 1,698 |
| [three.js (3D)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) | 465,000 | 105,000 | 1,977 |

Semio is built entirely on open-source foundations because lasting innovation grows in the open 🌍

Modern software runs on shared infrastructure 🤝 Instead of locking users in 🔒, big tech thrives by opening the core and building services on top 🧱

We don’t pay for libraries or APIs 🛠️ we pay for:

☁️ Cloud platforms and integrations⚙️ Productivity-enhancing features🔒 Secure and private workspaces🤝 Collaboration environments

The AEC industry made the mistake of competing on closed cores 🧱 with open extensions 🔓 that lock users in ❌

Semio does the opposite 🌀 The core is open-source 🔓 and the extensions can be commercial 💼

This lets the industry grow together 🌱 while companies can still stay profitable 💰

<a id="manual-over-automated"></a>
### [🖱️ Manual over automated](#manual-over-automated)

Automation should assist, not replace, the designer 🪛 In Semio, the goal is to give users full control 🕹️ over how things are configured, composed, and connected 🧩

You can use automation to speed up repetitive tasks ⏩  but it should never override your creative intent 🎨

This principle keeps design meaningful and intentional 🎯 It supports workflows where technology adapts to your design decisions 🧠  not the other way around 🔄

---

<a id="team-over-individual"></a>
### [👥 Team over individual](#team-over-individual)

Good tools empower collaboration 🤝 Semio is built for teams: it’s modular 🧱, interface-based 🎛️, and easy to share 📤

Different people can work on different parts of a system. Components, connections, and data without stepping on each other’s toes 👣

By supporting team-based workflows 👥, Semio enables more diverse ideas 🌈, faster development 🚀, and scalable complexity 🧠

---

<a id="composable-over-disposable"></a>
### [♻️ Composable over disposable](#composable-over-disposable)

Modular thinking lies at the heart of Semio 🧩 Every part you create is meant to be reused, recombined, or repurposed 🔁 not thrown away 🗑️

Systems should be built like LEGO 🧱  from pieces that can be taken apart and rearranged 🔄

This makes your work more flexible 🔀, durable 🏗️, and understandable 📚 Instead of rebuilding, you simply reorganize

---

<a id="implementation-over-specification"></a>
### [🧪 Implementation over specification](#implementation-over-specification)

Ideas come to life through making ✍️ Semio encourages you to build early, test often, and refine through direct interaction 🔬

Rather than getting stuck in abstract planning 🧾 or overly detailed specs 📐, you move forward by trying things out 🧪

Design becomes a living process 🌱  fast, iterative, and grounded in real feedback 🔁

---

<a id="integration-over-generality"></a>
### [🔀 Integration over generality](#integration-over-generality)

Semio is not here to replace your tools ❌ it’s here to connect them 🔌

Whether you use Rhino 🦏, Blender 🌀, Unreal 🕹️, or something else entirely, Semio integrates with what’s already working ⚙️

This principle avoids the trap of creating “yet another platform” 🧱 and instead promotes interoperability 🔄 and low-friction workflows 🧰

---

<a id="simple-over-complex"></a>
### [🔨 Simple over complex](#simple-over-complex)

Simplicity is powerful 💡 Semio encourages you to start with minimal building blocks 🧱 that are easy to understand and use 🎯

From there, complexity emerges naturally 🌱 as you layer, connect, and evolve the system over time 📈

Rather than overengineering upfront 🛠️, you design just enough — and let your system grow with you 🌿

---

<a id="example-over-theory"></a>
### [📖 Example over theory](#example-over-theory)

Semio emphasizes learning by doing 🛠️ Every feature is documented with clear, working examples ✅ that you can remix and reuse ♻️

Instead of long theoretical explanations 📚, you get templates, sketches, and proven patterns 🧩

This makes it easier for new users to get started 🧑‍💻 and for experienced users to contribute meaningfully 💬

---

<a id="architecture-over-modeling"></a>
### [🏛️ Architecture over modeling](#architecture-over-modeling)

Semio focuses on structure, not just form 🏗️ It helps you define how parts relate, behave, and connect over time 🔗

This is about more than just geometry 📐 it’s about designing systems that respond to rules, data, and interaction ⚙️

You’re not just modeling shapes 🧊 you’re building logic, behavior, and relationships 🧠

---

<a id="prefab-over-custom"></a>
### [🏗️ Prefab over custom](#prefab-over-custom)

Not everything needs to be custom-built 🛠️ Semio encourages the use of prefabricated components 🧱 that can be adapted and reused 🔁

This improves efficiency ⏱️, reduces waste 🗑️, and makes complexity manageable 🧠

You don’t lose creativity 🎨 you just gain leverage 🔧
