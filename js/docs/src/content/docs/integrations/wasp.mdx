## 🗣️ Terminology

🔌 Ports ↔️ CONNs
In semio, a Port is the little connector spot on a Piece that says where and how you can attach something
In Wasp, this is called a CONN with the same idea but frozen in place without any parametric rules

📦 Types ↔️ PARTs
A semio Type (your reusable mold for making Pieces) becomes a Wasp PART which is the base building block in Wasp’s world

🧩 Pieces ↔️ Transformed PARTs
A semio Piece (a placed copy of a Type) becomes a transformed PART in Wasp which is the same PART but now with its position and rotation fixed

🔗 Connections ↔️ Graph Grammars
A semio Connection can be parametric and rule-driven
In Wasp, this is a Graph Grammar rule with all connection logic written down explicitly

🏗️ Designs ↔️ AGGRs
A semio Design (all Pieces + all Connections) matches a Wasp AGGR which is the full assembled structure in Wasp

## 🔄 Integration

When semio talks to Wasp, it turns dynamic into static

🔌 Ports → CONNs Flexible placement rules are baked into fixed attachment points

📦 Types → PARTs Geometry + connection data are exported as reusable PARTs

🧩 Pieces → Transformed PARTs Same PART but placed exactly where it belongs in space

🔗 Connections → Graph Grammar Parametric connection rules are converted into Wasp’s fixed grammar format

🏗️ Designs → AGGRs The complete semio design is packaged as a ready-to-use Wasp AGGR
