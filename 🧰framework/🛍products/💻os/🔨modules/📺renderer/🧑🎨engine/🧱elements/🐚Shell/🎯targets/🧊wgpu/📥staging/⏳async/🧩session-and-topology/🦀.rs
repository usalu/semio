//! ⏳️ `shell-async` staging of `session-and-topology`: RENDERER-WP4 steps S0 and T1, the part of the former chunk that plan Appendix B and C (re-homed by the call graph) assign to this crate.
//!
//! Members of tier-1 crates are methods of their component struct with the lower components as parameters; use-case members stay `impl ShellState` and address the components as `self.<component>.<field>`; a private item that crossed a module boundary was widened to `pub(super)`.
