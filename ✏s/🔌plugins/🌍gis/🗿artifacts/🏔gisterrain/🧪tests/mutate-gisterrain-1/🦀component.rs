//! 🏔️ `s.gis.gisterrain` exhaustive mutation case — Rust adapter. Ticket 26/08/23/END-TO-END-TESTING-
//! REFACTOR. Recorded no-oracle decision `gisterrain-mutation-semantics`
//! (`../../🏅️standards/🔖️1/🪆️subsets/✳️any/🧪️oracle/🔣️component.json`, which also records why `geo`,
//! `geojson` and `gdal` were surveyed and DECLINED — the two verbs here do not edit geometry at all).
//!
//! Two persisted fields, an `f64` exaggeration and an opaque `imported_features_json` string, plus a
//! `mesh` slot that is not content but a CONTENT-ADDRESSED child handle derived from exactly those
//! two. So both mutations are root-scalar setters with a second-order effect, and the sharp check is
//! that the handle moves with the field and converges back on undo. The committed vectors move the two
//! fields independently, so a setter that wrote the wrong one shows up immediately.
//!
//! **Where the assertions live.** A recorded no-oracle case runs NO oracle role — the runner resolves an
//! oracle implementation from the feature's `@oracle-` tag and this feature has none — so every law this
//! case claims is asserted inside the SUBJECT handlers, through the shared law module
//! `✏️s/🔌️plugins/🗄️stdio/🧪️oracle/⚖️law/🦀️component.rs` that the stdio subsets use. The oracle handlers
//! below still answer with the committed vector read literally, so the reference side exists the moment a
//! second producer ever does. The subject half is gated behind the generated host's `sut` feature so the
//! oracle-only run never compiles the local implementation.
