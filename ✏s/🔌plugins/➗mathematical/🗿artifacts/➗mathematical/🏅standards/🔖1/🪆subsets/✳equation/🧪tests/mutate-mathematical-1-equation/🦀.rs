//! ➗️ `s.mathematical.mathematical` equation mutation case — Rust adapter. Relocated out of the
//! artifact-level `mutate-mathematical-1` case in ticket
//! `26/09/02/SEPARATE-ARTIFACT-STANDARD-SUBSET-IMPLEMENTATIONS-AND-FIXTURE-TEST-EVERY-MUTATION` so
//! `✳️equation`'s own kinds have a subset-owned test. Recorded no-oracle decision
//! `mathematical-mutation-semantics` (`../../../✳️any/🧪️oracle/🔣️.json`, which also records why
//! `petgraph` and the external CAS candidates were surveyed and DECLINED).
//!
//! 📐️ `change-coefficient` is this subset's only kind, and it carries a real, observable vector:
//! it raises the leading coefficient of the persisted polynomial to three halves, addressing term
//! label 2 through the never-reused `EquationNodeLabel` allocator and writing a `Rational` node
//! with decimal `numer`/`denom` lexemes rather than an `f64`, so a coefficient edit that went
//! through a float loses precision and fails.
//!
//! **Where the assertions live.** A recorded no-oracle case runs NO oracle role — the runner resolves
//! an oracle implementation from the feature's `@oracle-` tag and this feature has none — so every law
//! this case claims is asserted inside the SUBJECT handlers, through the shared law module
//! `✏️s/🔌️plugins/🗄️stdio/🧪️oracle/⚖️law/🦀️.rs` that the stdio subsets use. The oracle handlers
//! below still answer with the committed vector read literally, so the reference side exists the
//! moment a second producer ever does. The subject half is gated behind the generated host's `sut`
//! feature so the oracle-only run never compiles the local implementation.
