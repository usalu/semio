//! 🧪️ `delete-image` fixture — `removes-the-albedo-image-and-renumbers-the-texture-source`.
//!
//! `repair(Images, Delete(0))` walks `texture.source` only. The reference is optional, so a texture
//! sourcing the deleted image would silently lose its source; here the texture sources image 1 and is
//! renumbered to 0.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`), every value of which was transcribed from this
//! leaf's own oracle. The derived `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/`.pack.semio`/
//! `.patch.semio` encodings come from `fixtures generate`, not from here.
