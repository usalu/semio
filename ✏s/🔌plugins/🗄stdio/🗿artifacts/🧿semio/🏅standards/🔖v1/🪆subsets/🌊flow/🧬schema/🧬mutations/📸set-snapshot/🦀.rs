//! 📄 `set-snapshot` — authored as its own mutation leaf. The aggregate's original `diff`/`inverse`
//! bodies were lifted verbatim into `agg_diff`/`agg_inverse`; this leaf reconstructs its aggregate
//! value and delegates, so the semantics are preserved by construction rather than re-derived (same
//! shape as every other leaf in this folder, now that `SemioFlowMutation::SetSnapshot` is a tuple
//! variant wrapping this struct).
