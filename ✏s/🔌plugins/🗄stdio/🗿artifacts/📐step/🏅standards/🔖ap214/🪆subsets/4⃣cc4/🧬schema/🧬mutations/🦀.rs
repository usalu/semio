//! 🧬️ `StepCc4Mutation` — ISO 10303-214 CC4 (manifold surfaces with topology)'s OWN mutation vocabulary.
//!
//! 🎯️ Deliberately NOT the `🧱️base` subset's `StepMutation`. That one is the ISO 10303-21 GRAMMAR:
//! insert an entity, set an argument, remove an argument — eleven verbs that know nothing about
//! AP214 and would be identical for any Part-21 file on earth. A conformance class is not a grammar,
//! it is a FILTER, and the only edits that belong to it are the ones that move a document across the
//! filter. Every variant below is one rule of `check_cc4_conformance` (`../🦀️.rs`'s
//! `derived_analysis`), and there are no others because that function reads no other axis:
//!
//! | kind | rule | code |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `set-file-schema` | `FILE_SCHEMA` must declare `AUTOMOTIVE_DESIGN` | `CODE_FILE_SCHEMA` (hard) |
//! | `set-shape-representation` | no `*_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION` above rung 4 | `CODE_LADDER` (hard) |
//! | `demote-shape-representation` | the repair verb: rewrite an over-rung instance onto rung 4 | `CODE_LADDER` (hard) |
//! | `set-product-identity` | the `PRODUCT`/formation/definition chain | `CODE_PRODUCT_CHAIN` (soft) |
//!
//! 🪜️ **What this class admits, and what makes its vocabulary its own.** CC4 is the first class with TOPOLOGY: a manifold surface representation carries shells, and a shell
//! is a topological object, not a bag of surfaces. The ladder step CC4 refuses is the one to a solid —
//! `FACETED_BREP_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION` is a boundary representation of a VOLUME, and a class scoped to
//! surfaces has no conformant state that contains one.
//!
//! ⬇️ **The repair verb.** A demotion in CC4 turns a solid's boundary representation back into the manifold surface form.
//! The items survive the edit unchanged, which is the point: this class already understands shells,
//! so nothing an incoming rung-5 or rung-6 instance carries has to be discarded to fit.
//!
//! ⚠️ **A conformance class is not closed under inversion.** Undoing a ladder edit re-introduces
//! whatever the edit removed, and a class whose entire purpose is to forbid geometry above its own
//! ceiling cannot own a verb that writes geometry above its own ceiling back. `inverse()` therefore
//! returns the in-class verb whenever the base's own representation is admissible HERE, and degrades
//! to `SetSnapshot` when it is not — a real inverse either way (the projection is restored exactly),
//! but expressed through the only verb this class has for a document outside itself. That asymmetry
//! is recorded rather than papered over with a promotion verb this class must not have.
//!
//! @see ../../../🧱️base/🚪️io/🪜️ladder/🦀️.rs — the class-neutral edit implementations all six
//!      `✳️ccN` vocabularies route through, so each axis has ONE implementation and six callers.
//! @see ../🔣️oracle.json — the `step-ap214-cc4` catalog `KINDS` is checked against.
