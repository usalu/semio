//! 🧬️ DocxSnapshot schema (ecma-376/🔄️transitional) — reuses the ✳️any subset's `DocxSnapshot`
//! verbatim (the SAME Rust type, same `s.stdio.docx` schema id). ISO/IEC 29500-4:2016 Transitional
//! is a validation-gated dialect STAMP on top of that existing schema, not a new one -- see D4's
//! Tier-1 "same snapshot type, subset moves" semantics (`ArtifactCommand::MigrateDialect`). This
//! leaf exists so `🪆️subsets/🔄️transitional/🧬️schema/` is present per `🔣️taxonomy.json`'s

// 🧬️ This subset's OWN conformance-class vocabulary, mounted here rather than in the crate's shared
// `🦀️.rs`: that file is one wiring file for every stdio artifact at once, and the rationale the
// ✳️any subset already records for its own test mount — leave the shared file alone, let an artifact
// own the subtree it owns — applies to a production leaf of this subset just as well. `#[path]` on a
// non-inline module resolves against this file's own directory. The explicit declaration shadows the
// glob re-export of ✳️any's `mutations` above, which is what puts this subset's own vocabulary at
// `subsets::transitional::schema::mutations` while ✳️any's document vocabulary stays reachable at its own
// address.
