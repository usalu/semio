//! 🔮️ Mutation oracle for this subset — every CONFORMANCE-CLASS mutation the `pdf` `1.7`/`🗄️a`
//! subset declares, performed by the registered `lopdf` 0.44 reference implementation over the real
//! object graph of a real document, so the subject's own mutation has an independent result to be
//! compared against instead of being checked against its own reading.
//!
//! **What this subset's vocabulary is, and why it is not a copy of `🧱️base`.** The `🧱️base` subset owns
//! the DOCUMENT vocabulary — pages, media boxes, page content, `/Info` as authoring metadata, and the
//! raw object/dict/trailer edit primitives. This subset owns ISO 19005-2 / ISO 19005-3 (PDF/A-2, PDF/A-3), a CONFORMANCE CLASS,
//! which is a property of the object graph as a whole and of no page at all. Its vocabulary is
//! derived one kind per axis from this subset's OWN `check_pdf_a_conformance`
//! (`../🧬️schema/🦀️.rs`), which reads six axes: any Standard Security Handler `/Encrypt` dictionary object, any `/S /JavaScript` action or bare `/JS` key, any `/S /Launch` action, any `/Type /Filespec` carrying `/EF` without an `/AFRelationship`, an `/S /GTS_PDFA1` OutputIntent reachable from `/Root/OutputIntents`, and a `/FontFile`, `/FontFile2` or `/FontFile3` embedded program on every font's `/FontDescriptor`.
//!
//! What no other PDF subset here shares is the EMBEDDED-FILE pair. `/AFRelationship` is the single signal `detect_pdfa_level` uses to tell ISO 19005-3 (Part 3) from ISO 19005-2 (Part 2), and the checker's own hard rule is `/EF` present WITHOUT it; `set-af-relationship`/`remove-af-relationship` move exactly that bit, and no other subset in this standard declares them because no other subset's checker reads a Filespec at all.
//!
//! No `🧱️base` mutation moves any of those axes, and no mutation here touches page content: the two
//! vocabularies are disjoint by construction, which is exactly why this subset needs its own.
//!
//! The implementation lives in the shared `document::pdf_conformance` family module because all six
//! PDF 1.7 conformance subsets genuinely share the MECHANISM — every axis is a fact of the COS object
//! graph — see that module's own doc comment. What is NOT shared is which axes this subset polices,
//! which marker its OutputIntent demands and which kinds it declares: those are [`PROFILE`] and
//! [`KINDS`] below, and a kind this subset does not declare is refused here even when the engine
//! could perform it.
//!
//! @see ../🔣️oracle.json — the mutation catalog this module is measured against.
//! @see ../🧬️schema/🧬️mutations/🦀️.rs — the mutation vocabulary itself.
//! @see ../🧬️schema/🦀️.rs — `check_pdf_a_conformance`, the one axis list everything here derives from.
