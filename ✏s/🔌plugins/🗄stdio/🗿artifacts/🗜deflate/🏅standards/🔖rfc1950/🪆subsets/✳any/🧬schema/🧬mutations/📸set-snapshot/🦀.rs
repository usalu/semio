//! 📄️ `set-snapshot` — authored as its own mutation leaf. The aggregate's original `diff`/
//! `inverse` bodies were lifted verbatim into `agg_diff`/`agg_inverse`; this leaf reconstructs its
//! aggregate value and delegates, so the semantics are preserved by construction rather than
//! re-derived.
//! `#[derive(dsl::DslRecord)]` gives this leaf its own `DslField` impl with the SAME field spec
//! `record_codegen` built when this field lived inline in the enum variant — the aggregate's
//! tuple variant is a single-field newtype, so `#[derive(dsl::DslOps)]`'s `DslVariants` derive
//! delegates straight through to this leaf's own record, keeping the committed mutations
//! grammar/protocol facets byte-identical to before this leaf existed.
