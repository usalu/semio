//! 🚪️ IO stdio.svg (1.1/✳️tiny) — reuses the ✳️any subset's `xml` import/export leaves rather
//! than duplicating them (same `SvgSnapshot` type, same catalog DAG edge). Registration flows
//! through `🎹️composer::register` (the `ComposerEntry` via the standard-level aggregator, and the
//! `SubsetValidator` directly), not per-leaf `register()` — same pattern `✳️any/🚪️io` already
//! established for this artifact.
