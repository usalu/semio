//! 🧪️ `delete-load-case` fixture — `removes-the-live-case-together-with-its-loads`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! Loads are members of their case, so removing the case removes them with it — no separate load delta appears.
