//! 🧪️ `create-region` fixture — `🚫️rejects-a-duplicate-11ca0d`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! 🏢️ The model is the two-storey braced steel frame (6.0 m bay, 3.5 m storeys, HEB 200 columns,
//! IPE 270/IPE 240 beams, a CHS 88.9x4.0 brace, an RC infill panel with a window opening), the
//! SECOND real-world fem2d model — the first is the timber portal frame the subset-level
//! differential cases share. Every value is in SI base units.
//!
//! 🚫️ The duplicate-id guard runs BEFORE the material guard, so this payload is FATAL even though its material resolves. A self-intersecting outline, by contrast, is accepted — there is no geometric validation in this verb.
