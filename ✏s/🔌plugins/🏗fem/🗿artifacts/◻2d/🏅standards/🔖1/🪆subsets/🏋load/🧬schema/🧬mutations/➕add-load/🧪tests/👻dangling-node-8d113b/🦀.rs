//! 🧪️ `add-load` fixture — `👻️dangling-node-8d113b`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! 🏢️ The model is the two-storey braced steel frame (6.0 m bay, 3.5 m storeys, HEB 200 columns,
//! IPE 270/IPE 240 beams, a CHS 88.9x4.0 brace, an RC infill panel with a window opening).
//! Every value is in SI base units.
//!
//! 🛡️ This vector pins a branch the 26/09/06/FEM-PLUGIN-END-TO-END hardening wave ADDED; before it
//! the payload below was accepted (see `📓️w13-fem2d-semantics.md` for the per-kind rule table).
//!
//! 👻️ The asymmetry this closes: `create-load-case` resolved every load it carried, `add-load`
//! resolved none, so the very same nodal load was refused arriving inside a new case and accepted
//! attached to an existing one. Both now go through `guards::load_reference`.
