//! 🧪️ `replace-material` fixture — `📉️softens-the-2cd183`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! Only `g` moves, but the swap is whole-value: E, ν and ρ must be re-stated identically or the patch would silently reset them.
