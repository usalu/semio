//! 🧪️ `delete-material` fixture — `🏗️hall-cut-gl32c-264bca`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON bundle beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! 🏭️ `⬅️before` is the GLULAM WORKSHOP HALL, the second real fem3d model this artifact carries
//! (ticket `26/09/06/FEM-PLUGIN-END-TO-END`): a 12 m span × 12 m long two-bay GL24h portal hall,
//! eaves at 4.2 m and ridge at 6.5 m, braced by M24 steel rods and standing on a 350 mm C25/30
//! raft slab with a machine pit. Every quantity is SI — Pa, m, m², m⁴, kg/m³, N, N/m.
//!
//! The reserved GL32c glulam is struck; no member or solid ever named it.
