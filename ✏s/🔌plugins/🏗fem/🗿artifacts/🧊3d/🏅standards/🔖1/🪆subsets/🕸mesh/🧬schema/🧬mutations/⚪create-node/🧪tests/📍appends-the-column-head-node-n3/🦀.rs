//! 🧪️ `create-node` fixture — `📍️appends-the-column-head-node-n3`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
//!
//! A column head is coined 3.5 m above the origin — the third coordinate is what separates this from the fem2d node.
