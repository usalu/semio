//! ✒️ Writer plugin — declarative writer play app bundled as a hot-swappable WASM component.
//!
//! WIRING ONLY. Every `mod` below points at exactly one taxonomy component file with a `#[path]`
//! written in full, relative to THIS file's directory (`📦️packages/🦀️rust/`, per SHAPE V2 —
//! `26/08/05/SHAPE-V2-TREE-PURITY-BROADCAST` — so every leaf path carries a `../../` prefix to reach
//! back out to the owner-root tree). The grouping modules carry `#[path = "."]` so their own names
//! are not spliced into that base directory — without it, Rust
//! resolves an inline module's children under `<file dir>/<inline mod name>/…` and every leaf path
//! dangles. Do not inline any component file back into this one: the taxonomy validator and the
//! `TaxonomyLibShape` policy lint both fail on it (see master ticket
//! `26/08/05/CRATE-CONSOLIDATION-AND-PLUGIN-TAXONOMY-RESTRUCTURE`, Single-File-Repo hazard ruling).
