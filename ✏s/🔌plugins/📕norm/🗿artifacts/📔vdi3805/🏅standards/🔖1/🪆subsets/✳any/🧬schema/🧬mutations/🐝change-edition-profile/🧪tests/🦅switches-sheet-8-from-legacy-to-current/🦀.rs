//! 🧪️ `change-edition-profile` fixture — `🦅️switches-sheet-8-from-legacy-to-current`.
//!
//! The upsert rewrites sheet `8`'s existing override from `Legacy` to `Current`. Because the key already existed in `before`, the inverse is another `change-edition-profile` (back to `Legacy`), never a `remove-edition-profile`.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quintet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
