//! 🧪️ `scale-node` fixture — `🟡️doubles-node-a`.
//!
//! `node-a` carries no `scale` in the base snapshot; the builder writes `Some(2.0)`, so the field
//! appears for the first time rather than being overwritten.
//!
//! Source of truth is the committed JSON quartet beside this file (contract D1, ticket
//! `26/08/20/COMPOSE-TO-PUZZLE5D-MIGRATION`). The `.op.semio`/`.spr.semio`/`.dsl.semio`/
//! `.pack.semio`/`.patch.semio` encodings are derived from it by `fixtures generate` and are
//! asserted by the shared codec-matrix harness, not here.
