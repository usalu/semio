//! ➖ Retired. `remove-frame`'s generic `RemoveFrame{page_id,frame_id}` variant was replaced by the
//! semantic `delete-frame` triad (`🧬️mutations/➖delete-frame/`) — see
//! `.🦑️repo/🎫️tickets/🎆️26/🌙️08/☀️12/SEMANTIC-MUTATIONS-OVERHAUL/📓️taxonomy.md`. This directory has
//! no active payload structs and no `remove-frame` variant remains in `LayoutMutation`.
//!
//! The three empty leaf files under this directory (this one, `🔺️diff`, `↩️inverse`) are kept only
//! because `📦️glue.rs` — outside this facet's package boundary — still `#[path]`-wires them;
//! deleting the directory requires editing that shared file. Tracked as a `sharedFileRequests` item
//! in `.🦑️repo/🎫️tickets/🎆️26/🌙️08/☀️12/SEMANTIC-MUTATIONS-OVERHAUL/📓️wave2-reports/layout-layout-1-any-report.md`.
