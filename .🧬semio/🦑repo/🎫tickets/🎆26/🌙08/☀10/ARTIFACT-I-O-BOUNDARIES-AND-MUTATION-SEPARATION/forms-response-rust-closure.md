# Forms Response Rust Codec Closure

Moved the Rust physical CSV/JSON response export implementation and tests alongside the TypeScript owner. Semantic response values no longer mount export IO. Artifact table bridge, editor export work and export command directly consume canonical IO. The test fixture path resolves to the already shared IO fixture; no fixture copy was needed. Runtime verification is pending the parent Nx run.
