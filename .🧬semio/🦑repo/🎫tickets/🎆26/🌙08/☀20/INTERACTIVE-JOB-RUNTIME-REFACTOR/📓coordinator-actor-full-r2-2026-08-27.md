# Independent Actor Full R2 Checkpoint

The coordinator executed the canonical actor test target: **59 passed, zero failed, four files**, exit 0. Start 13:43:13; Vitest duration 4.85 seconds. The complete captured output follows.

The coordinator read the close codec/receipt laws, both transport lease tests and the generated-worker test. Strict neutral fixtures plus an existing independent LEB128 oracle cover the fixed bounded close envelope. Transport tests preserve captured worker/activation/request/close-generation identity and reject premature or stale retirement. The generated worker source actually executes in a Node worker for delayed-dispose/reused-activation behavior, but its ActorApi is injected and no real Wasm component is executed.

This does not supersede native exact-close R1 RED or prove complete runtime/reactor/UI/ACK retirement. Synchronous postMessage failure currently rejects the close promise while retaining the close owner, and the complete fatal/error/retry policy is still being implemented. Native published-patch handback and nested UiValue page retirement require exact per-instance witnesses, not global-arena emptiness. These obligations are assigned to the transport executor.
