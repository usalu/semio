# Independent Full React R18 and Strict R23 — 2026-08-27

## Actual Results

The canonical full React renderer suite passes577/577tests in five files, exit0; start17:16:47,35.29seconds. This supersedes R17's ten descriptor-admission failures. Strict R23 remains RED with exactly seven tutorial interactionSelection joins and no SceneBinding fixture or discovery diagnostics.

The run includes the new retained typed-scene and paired node/scene ownership tests, plus the demonstrator's extension completion/dispatch and strict descriptor admission regressions. This is a real full JavaScript test-suite result, not a fresh guest/Wasm, live UiNodeView or all-app performance certificate. The old synchronous live scene decoding and whole-buffer completion/patch paths still require bounded ownership integration.

## Coordinator Source Review

The typed projection retains source offsets/static defaults and an exact captured source owner rather than reconstructing user strings. Paired scene binding owns one root containing the node and prepared scene; captures cannot partially acquire a mismatched pair. Exact component identity permits reuse; equal content alone does not confer authority. Close retires prepared state before the node and retains independent text readers.

Native ScenePack typed parity currently covers15valid/6hostile fixture entries. Further integer-boundary tests are being added because the native numeric decoder uses unchecked narrowing casts. Generic IEEE floating-point wire support must remain separate from finite scene-geometry validation. Host-width admission for usize fields must be explicit. These newly identified boundaries are not covered by the earlier15/6 result.

Extension completion now returns settled/ACKed publication through the shared invocation decoder and refuses a locally destroyed instance. Root inspected the code. Exact activation-generation cancellation and bounded guest evaluation remain open. Array.from of completion payloads, synchronous frame decoding and retained-window patch conversion are not silently credited as bounded operations.

Descriptor loading now has one shared kernel implementation for React/WGPU-web. It refuses HTTP/HTML/invalid envelope/foreign owner/missing app roster before actor startup, while genuine extensions with empty app rosters remain valid. Full manifest semantic validation, bounded JSON parsing and the native ProgramBridge loader remain separate obligations.
