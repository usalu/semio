# Current Diff Contract Tests

Replaced obsolete Generation2D/3D view-setting assertions with sparse fixture override and generation-preservation laws. Each law reads literal camera vectors from a language-neutral JSON fixture, exercises the owned JSON codec and compares resulting camera output using Serde JSON. Block3D's text/binary law now consumes the committed command oracle. Raster checks that brushOpacity is absent from the encoded artifact diff. Note uses the existing framework facade for its utility action constant.

Registered ten direct glTF contract laws, two generation laws and four Block3D laws in the exact runtime runner. Rust sources and runner syntax parsed; runtime and compiler results remain pending.
