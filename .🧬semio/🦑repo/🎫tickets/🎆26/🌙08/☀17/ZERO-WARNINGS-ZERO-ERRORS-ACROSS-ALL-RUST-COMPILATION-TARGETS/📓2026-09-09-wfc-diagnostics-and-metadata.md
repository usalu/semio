# WFC Diagnostics and Metadata

Removed unpopulated symmetry-orbit metadata, which was always None and never read, plus unused scorer labels and an unused event-sink level getter. Existing weighting/scoring behavior remains covered by its tests. Strengthened cancellation, zero-observation-budget and restart-exhaustion tests to inspect report identity, progress and partial-state consistency. The weight-field identity test traverses its reported node extent.

Six Rust sources and runner syntax parsed. Registered six exact runtime laws. Runtime and full compiler verification pending.
