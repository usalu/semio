# 📌️ Binding rules — MICROKERNEL-POOLED-ACTOR-PLUGIN-RUNTIME

**Empty this file before `ticket_close`.**

## Hard prohibitions (every agent)

1. **No git-modifying commands.** No `commit`, `stash`, `checkout`, `reset`, `worktree`, `add`. Other sessions are live in this tree and an auto-commit bot runs. `git status` is NOT a churn detector — use `git log --oneline -3 -- <path>` and file hashes.
2. **No `ticket_close` / `ticket_reopen` by anyone but sol.** A subagent closing this ticket closes the whole umbrella.
3. **Never edit outside your packet's `path_scope`.** A region name inside a shared file is not ownership. Need a shared-file change → emit a `lease-request` block and stop.
4. **Never run bare workspace cargo.** Always `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<ticket>/🎯️target` and `-p <crate>`. A slow build is not a hung build.
5. **Scratch files are `.txt`/`.md`/`.json` inside the ticket folder.** Never `.log` (repo-wide gitignored — `ticket_close` silently drops them).
6. **Do not touch `.cargo/config.toml` or add per-crate `RUSTFLAGS`** — the uniform 512 MiB wasm limit is deliberate; per-crate flags churn cargo fingerprints across the whole fleet.
7. **Never claim a test passed without pasting its output and exit code.**
8. Temporary logs carry the `[DEBUG] ` prefix and are removed before a packet reports done.

## Registrar-only files (sol edits these; everyone else sends a `lease-request`)

`/📜️script.ts`, `/Cargo.toml`, `/Cargo.lock`, `/📋️project.json`, `.vscode/🧩️launch.seed.jsonc`, `.vscode/launch.json`, `🦑️repo/🔨️modules/📚️library/🔣️taxonomy.json`, `🔌️plugin/📦️packages/🟦️typescript/📇️registry/**`, all `🤖️generated/**`, `Shell/🧊️component.rs` (shared with live hover/selection tickets), `ShellHost/🟦️component.tsx`.

## Replace, never wrap — these must not exist at exit

`exchange` (WIT + all callers) · `PluginWorkerClient` (BOTH copies: `🎠️kernel/🟦️component.ts`, `🧊️wgpu/🟦️typescript/🟦️boot.ts`) · `LeasePool`/`PluginModuleLease` in the kernel (the generic `createLeasePool` relocates to `📦️packages/🟦️typescript/🟦️glue.ts` for its 3 non-plugin users) · `WasmPluginRuntime` · `ExtensionRuntime` · **both** `ProgramSupervisorState` definitions · `PLUGIN_FUEL_BUDGET` · `PLUGIN_WORKER_UNRESPONSIVE_MS` · `INSTANCE_GUARD`/`clear-instance-guard` · `host_port` · `component::host_*` · `install_io_fallback_dispatcher` · `set_host_backbone_channel` (process-global) · `runSerialized` retry/reload loop · `loadPluginModuleUncached`.

## Naming hazards

- `kernel::ActorId` **already exists** (re-export of `protocol_core::ActorId`, the presence/collab actor, `🎠️kernel/🦀️component.rs` L40). The runtime actor id is re-exported as **`RuntimeActorId`**. Never shadow.
- `🎭️actor` crate must stay pure: no `wasm_bindgen`, `web_sys`, `winit`, `tokio`, `std::thread` in the crate core — transports are injected. This is what keeps mobile open.

## Sequencing constraints

- The ABI flip is **big-bang**: A2/A3/B1 land and the fleet rebuilds before W3 fans out. The SDK crate is frozen during W3.
- `🗄️stdio` migrates alone and first in W3 (every plugin depends on it). `🎪️demonstrator` migrates last (bundles panes from cad/process/puzzle/procedural/gis/sourcing).
- Linked extension mode is feature-gated to avoid the `semio-framework-os-flow` ↔ extension crate cycle.
- Descriptor `extends` gates extension-actor activation on parent activity — a linked extension must not also run as an actor.

## Environment

- Disk was at 100% on 2026-08-17; freed by removing the `🎯️target` dirs of the two CLOSED tickets `☀️12/UNIFIED-COMPOSABLE-ARTIFACT-SYSTEM` and `☀️12/ENGINELESS-ARTIFACTS-AND-APP-STATE-MACHINES` (user-approved). sol checks `df -h` at every wave start and asks the user before deleting anything further.
- Ports: bench/parity use the 7300+ pool via `findFreeParityPortPair`, never the catalog ports 6012–6205.
- ≤6 concurrent building agents (cargo lock + disk).
