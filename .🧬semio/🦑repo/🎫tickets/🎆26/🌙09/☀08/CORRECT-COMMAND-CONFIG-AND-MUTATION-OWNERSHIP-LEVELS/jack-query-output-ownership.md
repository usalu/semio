# Jack Query Output Ownership

Query source is authored app configuration. Computed query output belongs to the live app transient store and must not be serialized into document/config snapshots or their diff projections. The runtime transition will publish one owned query completion with document mutations, query config, and a transient result together, without executing the query twice. The result is associated with the canonical operation id. Editor caret state is independent and keyed to the concrete editor window.

The result field and config mutation have been removed from every serialized projection below. Runtime retained-query and rendering integration is in progress; no passing native test is claimed.

## Query Work Cursor

The domain executor now has a retained cursor for one match candidate, filter row, or mutation item per step. Four neutral query cases compare the cursor against the existing synchronous executor and a serde JSON golden result. This implementation is not yet validated or connected to the app job factory. Graph construction, mutation revalidation, and final result assembly still use existing whole-graph helpers; those operations need an explicit cost/bounds review before claiming a fully bounded query job.

Added/updated: the executor `🦀️.rs`, `🪜️execution/🦀️.rs`, `🧪️tests/🪜️resumable-query/🔣️.json`, and `🧪️tests/🔬️unit/🦀️.rs`.

## Retained App Integration

Run Query and Load Example Query now share one retained query-work implementation rather than three copied synchronous helpers. Their completion publishes the typed domain `QueryResult` (or query error) to the app transient store, alongside authored query configuration and any document mutations. The output retains its graph child owner directly; serializing a graph result to a JSON string and parsing the opaque child handle back would lose that local owner. Results render from the transient request snapshot. Initial configuration no longer computes a result. The old example-loader helper is removed; the existing distinct menu actions remain declarations of the shared query operation.

This code is awaiting the typed transient schema implementation and native validation. The remaining whole-graph construction/revalidation/result-assembly and work cleanup costs must still be checked before claiming the query's interactive step budget.
