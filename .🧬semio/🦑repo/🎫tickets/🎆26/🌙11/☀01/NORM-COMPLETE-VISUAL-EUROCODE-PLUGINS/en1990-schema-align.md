# EN 1990 Schema Align

ReliabilityAnalysis and TestSeries now share one field order across the snapshot schema and the Rust model.

## Fields

ReliabilityAnalysis, after `actionSd`: `secondActionDistribution` (DistributionKind select), `secondActionMean` (N, display kN), `secondActionSd` (N, display kN), then the existing `memberId`.

TestSeries, after `theoryVariation`: `theoryMean` (number stepper). `pairs` and `theoryVariation` stay.

Omitted Rust literals use second action Normal / 0 / 0, empty `member_id`, empty `pairs`, `theory_variation` 0, `theory_mean` 0. Scene and compliance-report literals already passed those fields and were left unchanged.

Protobuf field numbers were appended. Existing numbers were not reused.

The diff patch schema stored `theoryVariation` as a string. It is a number now, matching the Rust `f64`.

## Documents

269 JSON documents under the EN 1990 artifact gained the new keys. Full rows use Normal / 0 / 0 and `theoryMean` 0. Sparse patches that already listed `memberId: null` or `theoryVariation: null` gained the new keys as null.

## Constructors

Every Rust struct literal that builds `ReliabilityAnalysis` or `TestSeries` includes the new fields. Insert and remove mutation payloads carry the row by clone, so they have no field list to extend.

SQLite still stores `member_id`, `pairs`, and `theory_variation`. It does not yet have columns for the second action or `theory_mean`. Decode fills Normal / 0 / 0 and `theory_mean` 0. Admission reads `member_id` at value index 10.

No constructor was left unfinished.
