Your only task is to make sure that text is in a consistent order.

- The order should be toolfriendly, meaning whenever something is used by another thing, it should be before the other thing. If there is a cycle then the lower level thing should be first.
- Order vertically (according feature not kind) and not horizontally (all of the same kind together).
