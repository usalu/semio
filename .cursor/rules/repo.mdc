# Project
An ecosystem for designing kit-of-parts architecture together.

# Guidelines
- Toolfriendly over intuitive.
- Almost everything is in a single file if possible.
- Folders are avoided if possible.
- No need to ask in between. Be opionionated and just go for it. Try to do as much as you can.
- Don't ask to execute commands in the cli. Assume all the tools are properly setup.
- No need to delete files, you can tell me when once you are 100% done with everything and I will do it manually.
- You are allowed to change everything (names, apis, creating/modifying/deleting fields, props, â€¦) and don't have to worry about breaking compatiblity. Choose the most elegant approach even if it requires changing more than necessary.
- Don't create additional example files and implement it directly in the dependent parts.
