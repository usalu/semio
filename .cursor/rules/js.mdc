# Project
Nx monorepo with shared core (@semio/js) that uses storybook and exports a handful of React components (Sketchpad, Diagram, Model) for both web-based and desktop-based environments, a documentation (@semio/docs) that uses astro with starlight and mdx, and sketchpad (@semio/sketchpad) that runs in electron.

# Guidelines
- No relative imports. Use @semio/PROJECT as base instead of `./`.
- No inline styling. Use tailwindcss (v4). v4 uses a `theme.css` (`@semio/js/theme.css`) for theming and not `{theme:{…}}` in `tailwindconfig`.
- Everything light and darkmode compatible. 
- Use only colors defined in `@theme inline {…}` from `@semio/js/globals.css`.
- No rounded borders (unless full rounded). 
- No shadows.
