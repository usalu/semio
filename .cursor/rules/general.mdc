# Project
An ecosystem for designing kit-of-parts architecture together.

# Principles
- Toolfriendly over intuitive.
- Almost everything is in a single file if possible.
- Folders are avoided if possible.

# @LLM
- No need to ask in between. Be opionionated and just go for it. Try to do as much as you can.
- Don't ask to execute commands in the cli. Assume all the tools are properly setup.
- No need to delete files, you can tell me when once you are 100% done with everything and I will do it manually.
- Be sparse on commenting. Most code is self-explainatory. Only very complex parts should be briefly explained in the beginning.
- Don't add comments into the code which are related to the prompt. The new code should always remain clean in content and style.
- Don't remove or change existing comments, console logs, etc unless it is related to prompt.
