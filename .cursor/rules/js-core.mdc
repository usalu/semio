# Project
Shared react components. The main component is Sketchpad. Sketchpad is used in three different szenarios:
1. As guest mode (readonly) in a statically generated pages.
2. As user mode in the browser (nextjs).
3. As user mode in a desktop app (electron).
Sketchpad has a local store in yjs which syncs with indexeddb and the backend provider.
There are two different undo managers.
1. User level: For creating and deleting kits, types and designs.
2. Editor level: For updating individual types and designs.

# Guidelines
- Internal components use `import {default as NAME} from "@semio/js/components/ui/NAME.tsx"` as import and external components use `import {NAME} from "@semio/js"`.
