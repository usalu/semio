# Project
Easy to use components with internal state managment (store internally uses yjs) for different modes (full, readonly) and light/dark theme.

# Guidelines
- Internal components use `import {default as NAME} from "@semio/js/components/ui/NAME.tsx"` as import and external components use `import {NAME} from "@semio/js"`.
